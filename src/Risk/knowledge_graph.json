      "summary_for_llm": "DIMO, a leading diversified conglomerate in Sri Lanka and the authorized distributor for KALMAR equipment in the country, recently delivered the state-of-the-art KALMAR DCU80 Empty Container Handler (ECH) to IWS Logistics (Private) Limited, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s premier private container depot operators. This delivery reflects DIMO\u2019s expanding presence in the country\u2019s container handling and logistics industry. Boasting an 8-ton lifting capacity, the newly delivered KALMAR DCU80 Empty Container Handler is specifically engineered to handle empty containers in container yards, enhancing yard management and operational efficiency. The DCU80, designed to improve space management, maximizes depot capacity and can handle a six-high stack of General Purpose (GP) containers. With its quick lifting capabilities and lowering cycles, the DCU80 dramatically increases output, boosts depot throughput, and shortens Prime Movers\u2019 turnaround times. Compared to traditional empty container handler, its new Smart Hydraulics with Load Sensing technology reduces fuel consumption and maintenance costs by supplying hydraulic power only when needed. Crucially, this also helps to reduce CO\u2082 emissions in the yard, providing container operators with an economical and environmentally friendly option. The DCU80, which was built using strong Scandinavian engineering principles, ensures reliable performance and endurance even in the harsh and demanding tropical climates, guaranteeing 24/7 operational capability. Its ergonomic and operator-centric design also encourages higher operating efficiency, increased predictability, and ease of use. Speaking of this milestone, Mr. Dimitri Sheriff, Director \u2013 Corporate Affairs of IWS Holdings Pvt Ltd, stated, \u201cIWS has trusted the KALMAR brand for decades. Partnering with DIMO as the local agent for KALMAR gives us peace of mind\u2014combining world-class equipment with excellent customer service, engineering expertise, and after-sales support. We are confident that the KALMAR DCU80 Empty Container Handler will greatly improve our yard operations and provide our customers with more value. This enables us to provide reliable, outstanding service for our clients.\u201d Commenting on the broader industry trends, Mr. Chaminda Ranawana, Executive Director of DIMO, who leads the Material Handling business in the group, said, \u201cToday, many container operators are looking for environmentally friendly ways to increase operational effectiveness. The DCU80 is an excellent example of equipment that KALMAR develops with a strong emphasis on sustainability. Compared to previous models or other manufacturers, it offers a notable reduction in fuel consumption due to its intelligent hydraulic systems and efficient powertrain. It is a great privilege for DIMO to support the goals of Sri Lanka\u2019s rapidly expanding logistics industry by bringing cutting-edge solutions that promote operational excellence and sustainability.\u201d DIMO\u2019s partnership with top brands like KALMAR highlights the company\u2019s dedication to improving Sri Lanka\u2019s logistics infrastructure and fostering a more efficient, greener future, while bringing the greatest technology from around the world to the country.

      "summary_for_llm": "Three-wheelers, or tuk-tuks, are a vital part of Sri Lanka\u2019s transport landscape, providing millions with affordable and efficient mobility each day. Behind the wheel of each tuk-tuk is a dedicated driver\u2014someone who works tirelessly to support their family, often under challenging financial circumstances. As the nation continues to navigate economic difficulties, these drivers are under increasing pressure. Yet, their resilience and commitment remain unwavering. Beyond their role in transportation, three-wheeler drivers often serve as first responders in emergencies\u2014rushing the injured to hospitals, helping stranded motorists, or offering rides late at night when no other options are available. Their contribution to society is significant, though frequently overlooked. In recognition of these everyday heroes, Orient Finance PLC has launched a heartfelt campaign that brings to life the real story of a three-wheeler driver. The campaign follows a day in his life, shedding light on the hard work, perseverance, and sense of responsibility that defines their profession. It aims to raise awareness of the struggles they endure while celebrating the vital role they play within their communities. This initiative is more than just a commercial\u2014it is a tribute to the three-wheeler community. Through this campaign, Orient Finance reaffirms its commitment to supporting these drivers, not only through words but with meaningful financial solutions designed specifically for their needs. Speaking about the campaign, K.M.M. Jabir, Executive Director and CEO of Orient Finance PLC, said, \u201cThese individuals are the backbone of our local transport network. They operate under trying conditions to deliver an essential service that many rely on\u2014whether for commuting, emergencies, or day-to-day mobility. At Orient Finance, we deeply value their contribution. Our role extends beyond financial services; we are here to uplift their lives. The First Month\u2019s Rental Waiver is just one of many steps we are taking to offer real, impactful support.\u201d At the heart of this initiative is the Orient Tuk Leasing plan, carefully crafted to meet the unique financial challenges faced by three-wheeler drivers. The plan offers a one-month grace period before the first rental payment, providing much-needed breathing space to manage household expenses, vehicle repairs, and maintenance. With low monthly installments and the option to borrow a higher amount, it helps ease the strain of ongoing costs. In addition, the approval process is quick and straightforward, ensuring drivers receive timely support without unnecessary delays. The plan also includes a Life Insurance Scheme, which provides Rs. 500,000 in support to a driver\u2019s family in the event of an untimely death. Already, more than ten families have benefitted from this safety net, reflecting the tangible impact of the initiative. For those seeking Sharia-compliant financial solutions, Orient Finance also offers Ijarah Tuk Leasing, reinforcing its commitment to inclusive and accessible services for all communities. Recognising that many drivers invest their life savings into down payments\u2014often leaving little to cover immediate needs\u2014Orient Finance\u2019s approach provides both short-term relief and long-term financial stability. The company\u2019s goal is to empower drivers to focus on what truly matters: their livelihoods, their loved ones, and their future. With this campaign and the enhanced leasing offering, Orient Finance PLC continues to stand with Sri Lanka\u2019s three-wheeler drivers\u2014not just as a financial institution, but as a true partner that listens, understands, and acts.
