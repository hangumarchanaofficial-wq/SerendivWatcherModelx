On the one hand, it\u2019s a great development success story in terms of social indicators.

Moving forward, Sri Lanka should really pivot and focus on exports, green economy and sustainability. These are also important for the transshipment positioning of Sri Lanka,\u201d he added. Fakhoury said scaling up digital services, agri-business and specialised manufacturing should form part of the country\u2019s diversification push. He noted opportunities in high-value tourism segments and urged expanding destinations in the Northern and Eastern provinces. He said the IFC would prioritise responsible tourism, export-linked investments, decarbonisation in manufacturing, value-added production and healthcare and pharmaceuticals.

He added that the IFC would continue to back sustainability and trade finance, capital market development and innovative instruments for real-sector growth. \u201cIn terms of infrastructure, we are very bullish on renewable energy, energy efficiency, mobility, ports and logistics and have full engagements under the World Bank group. Private-public partnerships will be critical, given the financing needs and the limitations of fiscal space,\u201d Fakhoury said, noting interest in new opportunities in telecommunications and logistics.

The approval covers Binance.com through three separately regulated entities in ADGM, an exchange, a clearing house and a broker-dealer, each granted distinct permissions to conduct trading, clearing, settlement, custody and over-the-counter activities. The companies, currently named Nest Services Limited, Nest Clearing and Custody Limited and BCI Limited, would be rebranded to reflect their new roles, Binance said. Nest Services has been authorised as a Recognised Investment Exchange to run a multilateral trading facility for spot and derivatives products, while Nest Clearing has been approved as a Recognised Clearing House with additional powers to provide custody and central securities depository services. BCI has been licensed as a broker-dealer with permissions spanning investment dealing, asset management, custody arrangements and money services. Binance said the \u201cglobal first\u201d provides regulatory clarity across multiple markets and strengthens the exchange\u2019s efforts to build a more compliant operating model. The company added that ADGM\u2019s regime, regarded by industry participants as a \u201cgold-standard\u201d framework, brings higher levels of oversight, operational resilience and consumer protection. \u201cThis reflects our commitment to compliance, transparency and user protection,\u201d Co-Chief Executive Richard Teng said, adding that the licence enhances the platform\u2019s legitimacy as it scales its institutional and retail offering.

The approval covers Binance.com through three separately regulated entities in ADGM, an exchange, a clearing house and a broker-dealer, each granted distinct permissions to conduct trading, clearing, settlement, custody and over-the-counter activities. The companies, currently named Nest Services Limited, Nest Clearing and Custody Limited and BCI Limited, would be rebranded to reflect their new roles, Binance said. Nest Services has been authorised as a Recognised Investment Exchange to run a multilateral trading facility for spot and derivatives products, while Nest Clearing has been approved as a Recognised Clearing House with additional powers to provide custody and central securities depository services. BCI has been licensed as a broker-dealer with permissions spanning investment dealing, asset management, custody arrangements and money services. Binance said the global first provides regulatory clarity across multiple markets and strengthens the exchanges efforts to build a more compliant operating model. The company added that ADGMs regime, regarded by industry participants as a gold-standard framework, brings higher levels of oversight, operational resilience and consumer protection. This reflects our commitment to compliance, transparency and user protection, Co-Chief Executive Richard Teng said, adding that the licence enhances the platforms legitimacy as it scales its institutional and retail offering.

The strategic shift was disclosed alongside the company\u2019s annual report for the 2024/25 financial year, where Odel reported a net loss of Rs.4.45 billion. Independent auditors Ernst & Young raised a red flag on the company\u2019s financial health, citing a \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d regarding its ability to continue as a going concern, due to the accumulated losses of Rs.12.7 billion and current liabilities exceeding the current assets by Rs.15.2 billion. In a major strategic shift concerning its mixed development project in Ward Place, Odel announced that the originally planned residential apartment component of Odel Mall will no longer proceed. The management has decided to repurpose the space allocated for apartments into rentable office space. The decision reflects a move to \u201cderisk\u201d the project, with the company noting that office space offers a more predictable revenue stream and lower development risks compared to the volatile residential market. The revised scope is also expected to reduce the overall funding requirement for the project, which currently carries a capital work-in-progress value of Rs.17.8 billion. To complete the construction of Odel Mall under this revised design, the company plans to raise Rs.4.5 billion in new funding. The financing strategy for the project has been updated to rely on advances from office space sales supplemented by external equity. This pivot is part of a wider remedial plan announced by Odel to address the negative working capital position that triggered its transfer to the Watch List. In addition to the mall completion, the plan includes adopting dynamic marketing strategies to boost footfall, closing the underperforming stores to reduce overheads and evaluating alternative financing sources. Crucially, the Softlogic group is actively seeking potential equity partners to infuse fresh capital into its retail sector, including the Odel group. On the debt front, the company is heavily leveraged, with total interest-bearing borrowings standing at Rs.20.77 billion as of March 31, 2025. A significant portion of this debt is tied to the Odel Mall project through a syndicated loan facility involving Hatton National Bank (HNB), Sampath Bank and Bank of Ceylon, with a balance of approximately Rs.8.2 billion. To manage this burden, Odel is actively renegotiating the debt repayment plans. The company revealed that the consortium of banks led by HNB has \u201cresponded positively\u201d and is currently evaluating the restructuring options for the syndicated loan and accrued interest. This restructuring is intended to align debt service commitments with the updated timeline of the mall project. Despite the financial strain, Odel\u2019s operational performance has shown signs of resilience. In the six months ended September 30, 2025, the group revenue grew to Rs.3.3 billion, up from Rs.2.7 billion in the same period the previous year. The company has also been aggressively rationalising its footprint, closing 17 underperforming outlets during the last financial year while opening new value-focused \u2018ODEL Brands Outlet Stores\u2019 to cater to the price-sensitive consumers.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts SriLankan Airlines issues special notice to pilots and cabin crew Security manager at Taj Samudra arrested for assaulting trainees IPL 2026 Auction: 3 Sri Lankans among top INR 2 Crore picks Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now Taj Samudra terminates security officer following internal inquiry Rainfall expected to increase from Thursday Tilvin Silva\u2019s Encounter with the Tamil Diaspora in London Protests by a few sections had no impact Massive landslide reported in Ankumbura, Kandy Govt. under fire for failure to mitigate disaster damage despite prior warnings      ", "content_hash": "e9207966978afe0df5512c49e4a17ca3", "scraped_at": "2025-12-08T22:41:10.301993", "updated_at": "2025-12-08T22:41:10.302001", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online HitAd TimesJobs E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads WNL Home By Nishel Fernando Odel PLC has scrapped plans for luxury apartments at its flagship Odel Mall project in Ward Place, pivoting instead to office space as part of a broader remedial strategy to address severe financial headwinds that have seen the retailer placed on the Colombo Stock Exchanges Watch List.

Rising AI-enabled deception, ESG misrepresentation and crypto-related schemes signal the need for governance models tailored to the region\u2019s behavioural and technological realities. According to ACCA\u2019s new report, \u2018Combatting fraud in a perfect storm\u2019, organisations across Asia-Pacific are contending with a diverse and fast-evolving fraud landscape, shaped by procurement fraud (34 percent), bribery and corruption (20 percent), and growing blind spots in crypto fraud and ESG misrepresentation. Rapid innovation in digital payments and super-app platforms has expanded attack surfaces, with AI-enabled deception accelerating the speed and sophistication of fraud across the region. Cultural dynamics remain a defining factor. In many Asia-Pacific markets, openly discussing fraud is still perceived as disloyalty, and hierarchical norms discourage whistleblowing. Independence of investigators and clear protections against retaliation are therefore critical, particularly for junior staff, who reported the highest levels of concern. Drawing on responses from over 2,000 professionals and 31 roundtable discussions around the world, the study \u2013 launched during International Fraud Awareness Week \u2013 underscores the need to embed behavioural risk assessments and align fraud-prevention efforts with local cultural realities Regional survey results show reporting ease averaging 3.82/5, with junior staff the most concerned about retaliation, highlighting a persistent imbalance in power dynamics that restricts upward reporting. Respondents emphasised the importance of culturally attuned governance, transparency of process, and leadership-led accountability to build trust. In collaboration with ACFE, IIA, CISI, ISC2, Airmic and ACi, the report introduces a new Prevalence vs Materiality matrix lens to help organisations make better decisions about allocating resources before fraud diminishes them.

Rising AI-enabled deception, ESG misrepresentation and crypto-related schemes signal the need for governance models tailored to the regions behavioural and technological realities. According to ACCAs new report, Combatting fraud in a perfect storm, organisations across Asia-Pacific are contending with a diverse and fast-evolving fraud landscape, shaped by procurement fraud 34 percent, bribery and corruption 20 percent, and growing blind spots in crypto fraud and ESG misrepresentation. Rapid innovation in digital payments and super-app platforms has expanded attack surfaces, with AI-enabled deception accelerating the speed and sophistication of fraud across the region. Cultural dynamics remain a defining factor. In many Asia-Pacific markets, openly discussing fraud is still perceived as disloyalty, and hierarchical norms discourage whistleblowing. Independence of investigators and clear protections against retaliation are therefore critical, particularly for junior staff, who reported the highest levels of concern. Drawing on responses from over 2,000 professionals and 31 roundtable discussions around the world, the study  launched during International Fraud Awareness Week  underscores the need to embed behavioural risk assessments and align fraud-prevention efforts with local cultural realities Regional survey results show reporting ease averaging 3.825, with junior staff the most concerned about retaliation, highlighting a persistent imbalance in power dynamics that restricts upward reporting. Respondents emphasised the importance of culturally attuned governance, transparency of process, and leadership-led accountability to build trust. In collaboration with ACFE, IIA, CISI, ISC2, Airmic and ACi, the report introduces a new Prevalence vs Materiality matrix lens to help organisations make better decisions about allocating resources before fraud diminishes them. Through its companion Calls to Action and Thematic Typology, the report also provides new guidance on assessing what works and doesnt  and crucially how to incorporate behavioural insights into risk governance, moving fraud prevention from compliance theatre to operational reality.

Speaking to Mirror Business, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Buddhika Hewawasam revealed that the scheme is now expected to come into effect from January, following necessary legislative clearances. The move is seen as a critical step in revitalising the tourism sector, which is central to the country\u2019s economic stability and immediate post-disaster recovery efforts. Earlier, The Hotel Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President Asoka Hettigoda revealed that industry leaders had requested the immediate implementation of a visa-free regime during high-level discussions with the President, Treasury Secretary, and Tourism Minister. Outlining a critical action plan for post-Ditwah recovery, the industry had urged the President to utilise emergency powers to expedite this process and immediately expand the list of eligible countries to maximise arrivals during the critical recovery phase. However, Hewawasam highlighted complications in implementing this under emergency powers. Consequently, the government has decided to secure parliamentary approval to ensure the process is legally robust. In terms of extending the number of countries beyond the proposed 40, Hewawasam noted that the scheme will be reviewed every six months. He indicated that the government could extend the number of countries in six months depending on the outcome of the initial phase. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be seen as desperate,\u201d he remarked, emphasising the need for a strategic and dignified approach to attracting visitors. The initiative to open the borders visa-free to a wider pool of nations is not new, having faced significant headwinds since its inception. The proposal was first aggressively pushed forward last year, when the Cabinet approved visa-free entry for 35 countries in August 2024, later expanding the list to 38 countries with the intention of immediate implementation. However, the move was paralysed by a Supreme Court interim order suspending the controversial VFS Global visa outsourcing deal, which threw the country\u2019s immigration processing into disarray. Since then, the comprehensive visa-free facility has remained in limbo. Foreign and Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath previously noted that the delay in implementing the scheme for the additional countries was largely due to awaiting clearance from the Attorney General\u2019s (AG) Department to resolve the legal entanglements left behind by the suspended visa deal. At present, only holders of ordinary, diplomatic, official, or service passports from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, and Thailand are eligible for a free Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA).\u00a0\nCurrently, the visa-free facility is limited to nationals from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, and Thailand. Under the proposed January rollout, this list is expected to expand to 33 additional nations, covering major source markets including the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nThe scheme also aims to capture high-potential travelers from across Europe\u2014specifically Austria, Belarus, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Furthermore, the government intends to open the facility to key regional and Middle Eastern partners, including Bahrain, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, and the UAE.

These plans will primarily target new domestic investors, aiming to provide opportunities to raise capital and create pathways for investors to exit the market. According to CSE Chairman Dimuthu Abeysekera, this year has been successful for the CSE, with the market witnessing an improvement of approximately 40 percent since January. Since September 2024, it has increased by more than 100 percent. \u201cMost of our investors are located in the Western Province. We want to move out of the province. Right now, the stock exchange has ten branches outside of the CSE with brokers involved, but we intend to have a branch in each province,\u201d Abeysekera stated. Currently, Sri Lanka has more than 900,000 Central Depository System (CDS) accounts; however, according to Abeysekera, only about 50,000 of these are active. \u201cThat\u2019s not even 0.2 percent of the population. We want to increase the number of accounts initially up to about 100,000, and we have to set up a few plans to do so. One such plan is conducting awareness campaigns outside of Colombo,\u201d he noted, adding that many Sri Lankans remain unaware of the stock market, possessing knowledge only of banks and insurance companies. \u201cWhen interest rates are down and people deposit their money, they get only about six to seven percent interest. When they have no place to invest their money, due to a lack of awareness, they get caught by criminals who promise around ten to fifteen percent interest monthly. We want to fill the gap so there is another regulated entity for people to invest in,\u201d Abeysekera said. Abeysekera also highlighted the CSE\u2019s collaboration with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) outside of Colombo, aligning with the SEC\u2019s new initiative \u2018Samata Kotasak\u2019 (A share or unit for everyone). \u201cWe are also speaking to many companies and are receiving a lot of applications for bond issuances, such as blue bonds and green bonds. We also had around two new companies float in the market,\u201d Abeysekera said, adding that the CSE is also targeting the involvement of the SME sector and other industries in stock market activities. Regarding the CSE\u2019s overseas activities, Abeysekera noted that while there were around Rs. 9 billion in divestments last year, divestments reached approximately Rs. 48 billion by November this year due to the 40 percent market expansion. \u201cInvestors took advantage of the market expansion and cashed in on foreign funds because they need to show profits to their owners outside of Sri Lanka,\u201d he remarked. Abeysekera remains hopeful that stock market prices will increase next year, allowing the CSE to canvas overseas markets. He indicated that the CSE will target the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the next quarter, followed by Europe or the United States. He made these remarks on the second day of the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit 2025, organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC).

The company confirmed that shareholder approval has already been obtained for the proposed capital infusion, which is expected to materialise in the second half of the 2025/26 financial year. In addition to the negotiations with prospective strategic investors for an investment ranging between Rs. 3 billion and Rs. 4.4 billion, the company\u2019s existing shareholders are anticipated to inject approximately Rs. 1 billion. These funds are earmarked to support the company\u2019s subsidiaries, several of which were flagged in June 2025 for facing a \u201cserious loss of capital\u201d situation where net assets had fallen below stated capital. The capital raising efforts come as the group faces continued financial headwinds. According to interim financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2025, Hela reported a consolidated loss of Rs. 4.1 billion, widening from a loss of Rs. 2.98 billion in the same period the previous year. Group revenue for the six-month period also declined to Rs. 32.3 billion compared to Rs. 42.98 billion a year earlier, reflecting a challenging global operating environment. Despite the operational difficulties, the group has made significant progress in restructuring its debt profile. Hela announced the successful completion of a restructuring arrangement for Rs. 15.1 billion in bank borrowings during the first half of FY 2025/26. The revised terms convert these facilities into a nine-year term loan with a one-year grace period for principal repayment, carrying an interest rate of SOFR + 1 percent for the first two years. This follows a Rights Issue concluded in October 2024, which raised Rs. 1.6 billion to settle banking facilities for its subsidiary, Foundation Garments (Pvt) Ltd. The details of the group\u2019s recovery plan emerged alongside the release of its delayed Annual Report for 2024/25, following a notification from the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) on November 28, 2025, warning of a potential trading suspension if the report was not submitted by early December. The company\u2019s auditors had issued a disclaimer of opinion on the annual accounts, citing material uncertainties regarding the group\u2019s going concern status due to a net liability position and overdue payables, though the Board remains confident that the restructuring and capital injection will drive recovery. As of September 30, 2025, the company\u2019s shareholding structure was led by Lesing Hela Limited, which held a 48.43 percent stake, followed by Tars Investments Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. with a 15.15 percent holding. P.L.D. Jinadasa held a direct and indirect stake of approximately 11.34 percent, while D.E.H. McVey held 1.87 percent.

REPA and other groups warned that this move could deter local investors and hinder the growth of the renewable energy sector. They emphasised the importance of energy supply for economic development and urged the Government to support sustainable energy initiatives. Darshana Liyanasekara, Chairman of REPA, highlighted the numerous benefits of renewable energy. He explained that generating and using sustainable energy aligns with global goals and fosters international cooperation. \u201cSolar power is highly feasible due to consistent sunlight and ample space for installation. It involves low investment and maintenance costs, minimal foreign exchange flow, and remains eco-friendly. The revenue stays within the country, boosting the local economy and creating jobs. Solar power supports the 2050 zero carbon energy goals, reduces production costs for local industries, and is crucial for meeting the 70 percent renewable energy target by 2030,\u201d he said. REPA Secretary Amal Sarathchandra addressed challenges in promoting solar energy. He noted that local investors are discouraged by unfair price revisions and delays in project approvals. \u201cTrust is further undermined by the suspension of new project contracts and inadequate support for existing installations,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial relief is hard to obtain, and the tax system imposes taxes on solar devices like panels and inverters.\u201d REPA Vice President Suresh Galanga emphasised the need to support local investors. He argued that while foreign investment offers temporary capital, it has long-term financial drawbacks, similar to foreign debt. \u201cMoney paid for electricity from foreign projects flows out of the country, much like diesel and coal expenditures,\u201d he said. \u201cEncouraging local investors through prioritised procurement guidelines and support is vital to revitalising the renewable energy sector.\u201d Chanaka Jayawardena, REPA\u2019s Treasurer said that boosting renewable energy generation, including solar power, would greatly benefit the country economically, given the high costs of fuel-based power generation. \u201cIn 2022 and 2023, Rs. 203.7 billion and Rs. 278.9 billion were spent on fuel-based power generation, respectively. This expenditure threatens the economy in both the short and long term. Installing 1,000 megawatts of solar power could add 1,320 gigawatt hours per year at a cost of Rs. 48.8 billion, while generating the same capacity with diesel would cost Rs. 92.4 billion.\u201d Electricity Consumers\u2019 Association President M.D.R.

The announcement made yesterday brings the much-needed financial support to industries and hotels. After having lobbied for lower electricity costs, the PUCSL\u2019s decision comes as a welcome change. Under the new tariff structure, hotels will be able to reap the benefit of a 26 percent reduction, while industries will see a 25.3 percent decrease. The overall reduction in electricity tariffs stands at 22.49 percent. The new rates are effective from today, July 16. The move is a notable shift from the series of tariff hikes imposed, which saw electricity costs soar by as much as 400 percent. The hike made it increasingly difficult for the industrial and tourism sectors to stay afloat. The tourism sector, which had managed to be categorised under the \u2018industry category\u2019 for electricity tariffs, after several episodes of tariff increases found itself paying exorbitant rates as it did when under the \u2018super-tariff\u2019 scheme. The private sector has been vocal about the overestimated tariff forecasts by the Ceylon Electricity Board, which led to unnecessarily high retail and industrial tariffs. However, their concerns did not receive much attention until now. Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel sector, a major contributor to the nation\u2019s export revenue, has repeatedly emphasised the need for a rigorous implementation of a least-cost generation plan. This, it argues, is essential for Sri Lanka to stay competitive, with the regions adopting low-cost generation and offering lower tariffs without subsidies. The sector also urged for power purchase agreements to be based on cutting-edge technology, with price discovery conducted through transparent competitive bidding. There is a strong call for policies that support the scaling up of renewable energy, including rooftop solar, in line with the government\u2019s goal of generating 70 percent of the country\u2019s energy from renewable sources by 2030. With increasing pressure from global brands for the decarbonisation of supply chains, Sri Lanka must move swiftly in adopting renewable energy solutions but at competitive prices, it said. 1 2 3 4 5  08 Dec 2025 7 hours ago 08 Dec 2025 8 hours ago 08 Dec 2025 8 hours ago 08 Dec 2025 8 hours ago 08 Dec 2025 8 hours ago General : +94 0115 335 731 +94 0112 304 545 Circulation : +94 0112 479 611 Advertising : +94 0112 479 561 Subscription : +94 0112 479 626 Technical : +94 011 538 3437 helpdesk@wijeya.lk All the content on this website is copyright protected and can be reproduced only by giving the due courtesy to 'dailymirror.lk' Copyright \u00a9 2004 Wijeya Newspapers Ltd.", "content_hash": "bafb24c68096a3d03905a6f374b9c2a8", "scraped_at": "2025-12-08T22:45:40.340509", "updated_at": "2025-12-08T22:45:40.340517", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Daily Mirror - Print Edition Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads Tue, 09 Dec 2025 Todays Paper 16 Jul 2024 - 975 Sri Lankas commercial sector can breathe a sigh of relief as the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka PUCSL approved the awaited reduction in electricity tariffs.

While southern resorts have been largely unaffected by the crisis, the problem areas are the hill country and the Northcentral Province. All tourist sites have been closed since Thursday while some travellers are considering postponing their visit plans. Some resort properties in Nuwara Eliya had been damaged while the rooms of a hotel in Kandy had been flooded forcing about 35 guests to be shifted to the bar area. At the moment tourist arrivals are being postponed without any further notice since accessibility to hotels (particularly to the hill country) have been blocked as roads are flooded, Nuwara Eliya Hotels Association former President Shaam Weerasooriya has said. But these postponements will not be subjected to any charges. Meanwhile, travellers already in the country on tour or just arrived have been taken to safe hotels and transit hotels. Mr. Weerasooriya said some travellers have been placed in hotels somewhere closer to Colombo like the transit hotels as these places are functioning well especially the city hotels. Transportation is also provided to these locations in which areas the roads are accessible. Some tourists have also been placed in hotels in Kandy that are currently full due to their inability to go further to hotels like in Nuwara Eliya. Hotels in Nuwara Eliya have been in touch with travel agents and tour guides to establish communication with their guests and ensure their safety while touring or visiting the country, Mr. Weerasooriya said. He noted that the hotels are very safe and that the transportation systems are safe as well and a system to protect travelers when moving from one place to another. The Tourist Police has also been located in almost all police stations in areas where travelers are lodging to ensure their safety. Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators President Nalin Jayasundere said that they are ensuring the safety of all travellers and not taking any risks since certain roads are not passable. However, he noted there are no cancellations at present. Sri Lanka is reportedly facing the worst climatic conditions with incessant rains and strong winds resulting in 56 deaths, 14 injured and 21 displaced as at 9 am on Friday according to the Disaster Management Centre. This stormy weather named Ditwa has impacted 20 districts in the country. So far the main rivers have overflowed causing a flood situation in most areas and as a result of the heavy rains earth slips and landslides have been reported from a number of hilly areas due to which roads and railway lines have hampered travel to and from a number of districts. The crisis comes just as Sri Lanka is targeting 2.3-2.5 million tourists in 2025.

The move, approved by Cabinet in November 11, comes after the Central Bank flagged serious concerns about the long-term survival of both institutions. Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe did not mince words this week when he described the two specialised lenders as \u201cburdened with unsustainable business models, poor profitability and an inability to meet minimum capital requirements\u201d. Speaking at a media briefing, he said the regulator had drawn up a \u201ctargeted consolidation plan\u201d focusing on smaller banks to safeguard financial sector stability and protect depositors. According to the plan, the government\u2019s entire shareholding in HDFC incorporated under the Housing Development Finance Corporation Act of 1997 will be transferred to Bank of Ceylon (BOC), which will operate HDFC as its subsidiary.\u00a0 The State Mortgage and Investment Bank, established in 1975, will become a subsidiary of People\u2019s Bank (PB) under a similar transfer of state-owned shares. Dr. Weerasinghe highlighted that both HDFC and SMIB had \u201clow risk densities due to their heavy reliance on Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF)-backed loans\u201d, which carry zero risk-weighting but also reflect the narrowness of their loan books. Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings, in its latest review, supported this view, noting that the proposed transfers are unlikely to affect the ratings of BOC or PB. Several financial and banking analysts fear that once absorbed into larger banks, low-income housing borrowers traditionally served by these institutions could be de-prioritised in favour of more commercially attractive segments.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a warning to the public of a scam by this company noting that it is not licenced by the SEC and has no authority to trade in securities on behalf of investors.

Officials at the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) told The Sunday Times Business that they were able to control the spread of the disease by taking the right measures and cutting down the affected trees. It was noted that there was no medication or chemical that could be used to eradicate this disease that had affected some coconut trees in the Galle, Weligama and parts of Hambantota district. The only solution for the eradication of the disease was to cut down the tress and then destroy them where the insects are found. Officials note that no medical solution had been found anywhere else in the world either. It was pointed out that once these affected trees were cut down no new plants were allowed to be replanted for about the last seven years since the threat of the spread of the disease was high. During this time the CRI has ensured that the rest of the coconut plants are monitored by maintaining a radius of 3km where the disease is less prevalent. Within and outside this 3km border, areas are being monitored and as a result some areas have now been released for new replanting with a disease resistant variety. The resistant variety is produced by making a Green Dwarf coconut plant cross with a tall variety that is called CRIC 365. For the first time last year replanting commenced by the CRI. Another preventive measure adopted by the authorities was to not send the coconut plucked out of these areas outside of the region they were cultivated in a bid to control the spread of the disease to other parts of the country. Of the approximately 65 million coconut trees in the country only about 300,000 have been affected and cut down. Due to the constant monitoring carried out by the CRI the authorities in Sri Lanka have been able to control the spread of the disease to any other areas. The disease is still prevalent in these parts of the country and it continues to be monitored by the CRI.

This model encourages continuous innovation through competition, accelerates service quality improvements, and eliminates the government\u2019s need for large upfront investment, Hasith Yaggahavita, CEO of 99X, said. This will fast-track the development of digital public infrastructure and significantly strengthen the country\u2019s digital economy, Mr. Yaggahavita, CEO of 99x, told the Sunday Times Business. He said that governments are increasingly looking at innovative methods to increase the delivery of public services, and a promising approach will be developing APIs for citizen services, which allows private companies, including start-ups and university students, to create applications that utilise these API\u2019s. This will decrease public expenditure and also boost ongoing innovation and cultivate a competitive digital ecosystem, he added. He also noted that many countries, such as India, the UK, and Rhonda, have implemented such methods. \u201cA technical model can be created here where the government exposes secure API related to identity, taxes, fines, land records, postal services and utilities,\u201d he added.

He said that this rich tapestry of food would be an occasion to celebrate diversity. The suggestion came just as the government announced the Sri Lanka Day event to be held in December as a means of bridging the ethnic divide and celebrating Sri Lanka\u2019s multicultural societies. He is still waiting for a reply! That person was our young economist Ruwanputha . He called me on this Thursday morning to discuss the same topic, after reading about JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva, during a visit to London, inviting Sri Lankans to come home for the three-day festival from December 14 to 16 and celebrate the event\u2019s unity theme. \u201cI wrote to Sri Lanka Tourism many months ago to organise a food fiesta featuring the food of many communities for tourists and Sri Lankans, but sadly they didn\u2019t respond. Not even an acknowledgement of the email. This is the kind of public service that we have today. Here is an idea that they should take forward, as food is a great way to bring communities together, but sadly they didn\u2019t respond,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the problem in Sri Lanka\u2026..there is limited space in the public service for creativity and innovation. No one listens if you have a good idea. That happens only in the private sector,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe if I had proposed the idea to tourism industry associations it may have been taken on board,\u201d he said. Ruwanputha\u2019s suggestion was a simple one. December is the period when the country is filled with tourists (coming during the winter season) and also Sri Lankans resident abroad returning home for their annual year-end vacation and it is good to celebrate Sri Lanka Day with a food festival. The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said that the government was promoting Sri Lankan Day as a national platform to bring every community together. While the vision behind this event would be to create a space where all citizens can feel included and respected regardless of political, religious or cultural identity, it pointed out that it is \u201cimportant that opposition parties and civil society organisations are also included, so that the event reflects the full diversity of the country\u201d. While peace and reconciliation are considered the barometer of success of a society, one of the most forgotten aspects of culture and diversity is the colourful range of food of the different communities. Real peace and reconciliation has eluded Sri Lanka, despite efforts by many governments. One very easy aspect of bridging the ethnic divide is food and music. The diversity of food cuts across many cultural barriers. In fact in recent times, many tourists keen on learning the country\u2019s culture have visited villages and watched how food is prepared. In one step further in this process, they have also joined in the cooking, pounding ingredients in a stone mortar, preparing string hoppers and hoppers and other everyday food. Consider the rich variety of Sri Lankan food coming down the ages and influenced by our colonial masters. From the Sinhalese, you have Ambul Thiyal, a sour fish curry, Kaju Maluwa, a cashew curry, Kottu, a battered mixture of meat, vegetables and rotti made to the exciting sounds of the baila, Kiribath and Pol Sambola. From the Tamils come Appam and Indiappam (hoppers and string hoppers) from South India, Murukku, Pittu and Kiri Toffee, though some may argue that the latter is a food developed by the Sinhalese. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the food and its exquisite taste that matters, not from where it originated. The Malay community is famous for Dodol, Satay (fried beef) and Achcharu which comes from the Malay word Achar known as Malay pickle, while the Burghers celebrate their rich past with Lamprais, Rich Cake and Breudher. The small Borah community contribution is through Bombay sweets which includes Muskat. Then consider the variety of music and dances with baila, a Portuguese-origin musical song and dance form, taking pride of place. In fact, when the baila is played at family and public functions, guests let their hair down and join in the singing and dancing\u2026\u2026.communities get together and it\u2019s like time spent in the kindergarten where it didn\u2019t matter if your fellow student came from a different community. There was no class distinction or barriers on racial lines. Everyone was alike and teachers made sure everyone was treated equally. Food and music are great ways to overcome divisions and hostility among races and bring better results than speeches and special events heralding Sri Lanka\u2019s diversity. Consider a band like the Gypsies and its late, legendary leader Sunil Perera. He would have been the ideal ambassador of peace. His iconic song \u2018Piti Kotapan None\u2019 is a staple offering at many functions and weddings. Music and food indeed bring the world together and what better place than Sri Lanka where you enjoy a shot of arrack among friends with a variety of side dishes as bites. After becoming tipsy, enmity and bitterness are forgotten \u2013 we all become machans! Hotels sometimes organise festivals of food of other countries \u2013 why not the food of Sri Lanka\u2019s cultural tapestry! The government has chosen an ideal time \u2013 December, to celebrate Sri Lanka\u2019s diversity.

While these plans are still at a nascent stage, expansion outside the country is definitely on the cards in the next five to 10 years, officials said, responding to a question by The Sunday Times Business at a media event hosted by the company recently. They said that the company is quite optimistic about the current market and is geared to cater to all the segments while being bullish on opening branches and expanding island-wide. Laksanda Gunawardena, CEO of MI Finance, stated that the company has opened 43 branches over the past 18 months. \u201cBy the end of this financial year, we hope to bring our branch network to 91,\u201d he said.

In an industry average of 8 per cent non-performing loan ratio, the company is maintaining a 2.8 per cent net average.

The profitability surge was achieved alongside robust 40 per cent annualised growth in deposits, mobilised through the company\u2019s expanded network of 85 branches, Mr. Gunawardana added. He also noted that MI Finance is extremely positive about the Secure Transaction Registry recently launched by the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB).

This year\u2019s celebrations are especially significant as they coincide with FAO\u2019s 80th anniversary, eight decades dedicated to support sustainable fisheries, food security, and coastal livelihoods worldwide.

Observed globally on November 21, World Fisheries Day recognises the importance of sustainable fisheries for food security, livelihoods and economic growth. It calls attention to the need for responsible management of aquatic resources, better working conditions for fishers, and greater recognition of their role in local and global aquatic food systems.

While Capital Metals PLC positions the project as a world-class resource development with transformative economic potential, newly detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) findings reveal a more complex, high-stakes picture along the island\u2019s fragile eastern coastline. The project\u2019s potential and favourable economics were highlighted at a recent promotional event hosted by the Sri Lankan High Commission in London. Officials emphasised improving macroeconomic indicators, policy reforms and an upcoming Investment Protection Act aimed at strengthening investor confidence. Capital Metals\u2019 phased development strategy keeps upfront capital low. An initial US$25 million investment is expected to generate $35-40 million in annual revenue at sub-$20 million operating costs. The total project requires $80 million, and despite higher taxes and royalties introduced in Sri Lanka, updated modelling shows a strong Net Present Value of $180 million. Local partnerships are central to navigating regulatory complexities. Ambeon Capital\u2019s $4 million investment for a 20 per cent stake has strengthened the company\u2019s domestic presence. The firm currently holds the only mineral-sands mining licence in the country and awaits two further approvals-licence expansion and export clearance. With first production targeted for early 2027, Capital Metals argues that the Taprobane project represents a rare opportunity: a high-grade, low-cost, strategically located mineral asset trading at a market value well below its economic potential. The project is located on the Akkaraipattu-Komari coastal belt in the Ampara District, Eastern Province, close to the towns of Pottuvil and Akkaraipattu. This 50-300 metre-wide stretch of beach known for its rich deposits of ilmenite, rutile, zircon, garnet and sillimanite has been divided into five sections: Tampaddai, Thirukkovil, Mulliadi, Omari and Sangamankanda. The total recoverable heavy mineral content is estimated at 5.43 million tonnes, making it one of the highest-grade undeveloped deposits globally. However, the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for the proposed mining operation offers a measured warning while granting overall clearance and concluding that the project\u2019s economic benefits outweigh environmental costs. The assessment identifies significant ecological risks. Two rare plant species, five endemic species and 12 nationally threatened plants have been recorded on the sand dunes set to undergo mining. The report states that disturbing such habitats will have \u201cmajor impacts on the ecology and biodiversity of the area\u201d. Although lagoons and mangroves fall outside the direct mining zone, the EIA warns of indirect disturbances to wildlife due to dust, noise and vibration. Strict mitigatory measures, continuous monitoring and early-warning systems have been recommended to prevent long-term ecological harm.

While Polonnaruwa\u2019s average yield currently stands at around 4.5 metric tonnes per hectare, agricultural experts estimate the potential yield at approximately six metric tonnes. To help bridge this gap, the programme focused on creating awareness about modern cultivation methods, responsible use of agro-chemicals, mechanisation, financial management, and environmental sustainability. The bank said the initiative aims to position Polonnaruwa as a model district for sustainable, GAP-based paddy cultivation. It also seeks to promote financial inclusion among rural communities by connecting farmers with formal banking channels and customised financial solutions to fund mechanisation, crop diversification, and value-added processing.

JXG Janashakthi Group has announced consolidated results for the first half of the financial year 2026 1H FY26, ending September 2025, demonstrating solid momentum in profitability and strong growth across key financial and operational metrics. We are pleased to see the positive trajectory continue into the first half of FY26, with performance surpassing the previous year, said Ramesh Schaffter, Managing Director Group CEO, JXG Janashakthi Group, in a media release.

This move will bring a large number of small retailers into the tax net and ultimately pass the 18 per cent VAT burden onto consumers. It will also create an imbalance in the economy, as most consumers will shift their purchases toward goods and services provided by businesses that are not liable for VAT. At a time when people are already struggling with the rising cost of living, this will be yet another blow to both small enterprises and the wider population,\u201d asserted Mahendra Perera, President of the Ceylon Federation of MSME, adding that many shops and small businesses will be trapped in this financial dilemma. Speakers at the event: Mr. Mahendra Perera (left) and Mr. G. K. Sudath Kumar. Pic by M.A.Pushpa Kumara. He was speaking at the Sunday Times Business Club (STBC)\u2019s bi-monthly meeting on Tuesday which focused on the \u2018collapse of small Sri Lankan businesses\u2019 owing to the Easter Sunday attack, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. The host hotel of the meeting is Shangri-La and the sponsor of the club is NDB Bank. He said like in many other countries, the MSME sector is the backbone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. MSMEs contribute 52 per cent to the national GDP and provide employment to 4.5 million people in the workforce. Quoting 2022 data from the Department of Census and Statistics, he said out of 1.3 million MSMEs, 263,000 have permanently closed, 14,577 are temporarily closed, and approximately 1,050,000 remain active. This data represents the situation up to 2022; however, the major impacts of the economic crisis was felt most strongly in 2023\u20132024. \u201cTherefore, we believe that an additional 100,000 or more enterprises have already been affected due to the bankruptcy declaration and the sharp rise in interest rates,\u201d he added. Mr. Perera said while parate execution was temporarily suspended, the extension ended in March 2025 and now a large number of MSME assets are already in the process of being auctioned. The Parate Act, which dates back to 1990, urgently needs to be amended to reflect current economic realities. Although the present government issued two circulars in December 2024 and January 2025, these have failed to address the core issues faced by MSMEs, pointing out that even though Rs. 50 billion was allocated for the MSME sector in the 2026 Budget, more than 60 per cent of MSMEs are listed in CRIB with Non-Performing Loan (NPL) status, making access to capital finance extremely difficult. The second speaker at the event, liquidator expert G. K. Sudath Kumar, Partner \u2013 Nanayakkara & Company, detailed out the various options offered to bankrupt firms via the process of an administrator or, if that doesn\u2019t work, liquidation. He said many companies are going into liquidation, and faced with the growing number of cases, one of the commercial high courts has been set aside purely for liquidation cases. When a company is unable to pay its debt, the directors of the company seek court permission to either wind up the company or declare bankruptcy. An administrator is then appointed, as a first step, to see whether the company can be revived after speaking to all creditors and debtors on restructuring due payments and restructuring the debt. In some cases, resuscitation succeeds, in some cases it won\u2019t. It\u2019s a fine balancing act by the administrator, he pointed out adding that in the Sri Lanka case, many people don\u2019t trust an administrator and this is an issue.

What began as government policy rooted in environmental concerns has now created a widening economic gap one that industry stakeholders warn could take years to repair without urgent government intervention, industry stakeholders said Since the CPO import ban came into effect in April 2021, Sri Lanka has spent over US$175 million importing edible oils to meet domestic demand-an expense the country can ill afford amid its ongoing balance-of-payments pressures. Although a functioning oil-palm industry once supplied part of the almost-264,000 metric tonnes consumed annually domestically, the nation continues to depend nearly wholly on imports The fallout has been especially severe for Board of Investment (BOI) enterprises that relied on CPO as a key raw material for exports. These manufacturers once regular suppliers of hydrogenated palm-oil products such as vanaspathi ghee, bakery shortening, CBS fats and chocolate fats have collectively incurred losses estimated at $40 million. Their export pipelines collapsed after access to CPO was cut off in 2022, despite preferential market access under the Indo\u2013Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA). Ironically, India Sri Lanka\u2019s largest trading partner has recently reopened the same HS codes for palm-oil-based imports, while simultaneously increasing its own edible-oil tariffs. The result is a surge in demand for Sri Lankan processed palm-oil exports, but domestic producers remain paralysed without access to CPO. Industry representatives, in a detailed submission to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, have called for an immediate policy reset. They seek approval for BOI-registered companies to import CPO (HS Code 1511.10) through a tightly regulated licensing mechanism. Such a step, they argue, would restore export production, support domestic edible-oil supply chains, and generate an estimated $75 million annually in new export revenue. The appeal goes beyond short-term import relief. Plantation companies are also urging the government to lift the nationwide prohibition on new oil-palm cultivation a ban introduced in 2022 that abruptly halted a sector specifically developed to reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s edible-oil deficit. They propose a structured replanting programme of 10,000 acres annually, projecting that the country could achieve edible-oil self-sufficiency and even generate an export surplus within six years. Their argument is rooted in regional trends. India, which imports nearly eight million tonnes of palm oil annually, has already launched a massive programme to cultivate oil palm on five million hectares-a signal that palm cultivation, when regulated, is strategically valuable for food security. As Sri Lanka prepares for its 2026 shift from the Special Commodity Levy to a more predictable ad valorem tax structure for imported oils, one question lingers on: will policy reform come soon enough? The answer might mean life or death for manufacturers, plantation workers, and rural communities whose livelihoods depend on the sector.

By Bandula Sirimanna Sri Lankas prolonged ban on new oil-palm cultivation and crude palm oil CPO imports has evolved into a costly economic dilemma, draining scarce foreign exchange, weakening export competitiveness, and placing thousands of livelihoods at risk. What began as government policy rooted in environmental concerns has now created a widening economic gap one that industry stakeholders warn could take years to repair without urgent government intervention, industry stakeholders said Since the CPO import ban came into effect in April 2021, Sri Lanka has spent over US175 million importing edible oils to meet domestic demand-an expense the country can ill afford amid its ongoing balance-of-payments pressures. Although a functioning oil-palm industry once supplied part of the almost-264,000 metric tonnes consumed annually domestically, the nation continues to depend nearly wholly on imports The fallout has been especially severe for Board of Investment BOI enterprises that relied on CPO as a key raw material for exports. These manufacturers once regular suppliers of hydrogenated palm-oil products such as vanaspathi ghee, bakery shortening, CBS fats and chocolate fats have collectively incurred losses estimated at 40 million. Their export pipelines collapsed after access to CPO was cut off in 2022, despite preferential market access under the IndoSri Lanka Free Trade Agreement ISFTA. Ironically, India Sri Lankas largest trading partner has recently reopened the same HS codes for palm-oil-based imports, while simultaneously increasing its own edible-oil tariffs. The result is a surge in demand for Sri Lankan processed palm-oil exports, but domestic producers remain paralysed without access to CPO. Industry representatives, in a detailed submission to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, have called for an immediate policy reset. They seek approval for BOI-registered companies to import CPO HS Code 1511.10 through a tightly regulated licensing mechanism. Such a step, they argue, would restore export production, support domestic edible-oil supply chains, and generate an estimated 75 million annually in new export revenue. The appeal goes beyond short-term import relief. Plantation companies are also urging the government to lift the nationwide prohibition on new oil-palm cultivation a ban introduced in 2022 that abruptly halted a sector specifically developed to reduce Sri Lankas edible-oil deficit. They propose a structured replanting programme of 10,000 acres annually, projecting that the country could achieve edible-oil self-sufficiency and even generate an export surplus within six years. Their argument is rooted in regional trends. India, which imports nearly eight million tonnes of palm oil annually, has already launched a massive programme to cultivate oil palm on five million hectares-a signal that palm cultivation, when regulated, is strategically valuable for food security. As Sri Lanka prepares for its 2026 shift from the Special Commodity Levy to a more predictable ad valorem tax structure for imported oils, one question lingers on will policy reform come soon enough? The answer might mean life or death for manufacturers, plantation workers, and rural communities whose livelihoods depend on the sector.

To relegate AI to next year\u2019s agenda is to overlook its profound capacity to reshape operational paradigms, accelerate innovation, and redefine competitive advantage. Organisations can start with enterprise AI gradually, focusing on incremental use cases that drive efficiency and innovation without requiring major budgets or disruptive system changes. Yet, this promise is interwoven with nuances and intricacies that boards must navigate with discernment. The mandate is not to stifle adoption but to enable it responsibly, embedding AI within a governance architecture that harmonises ambition with accountability. AI is revolutionising how leaders and teams manage complexity, but its power must be guided responsibly. Board members can receive concise summaries of lengthy board papers before meetings, saving hours of preparation, while CEOs leverage AI to draft strategic briefs or scenario analyses in minutes. CFOs gain rapid financial insights, company secretaries can turn meeting transcripts into accurate minutes, and auditors accelerate risk reviews with AI-assisted checks. Sales teams prioritise leads, and call centre managers analyse customer sentiment instantly. These capabilities are real and accessible today, but they demand human-in-the-loop oversight, especially as organisations experiment with automated decision-making in areas like credit approvals, recruitment screening, and compliance alerts. Boards must ensure these systems remain transparent, explainable, and subject to human override to prevent bias, errors, and regulatory breaches. Achieving this balance calls for a truly cross-functional approach, aligned with the organisation\u2019s defined and regularly revisited risk appetite and tolerance levels. Boards set the strategic vision and provide oversight, while ICT and data teams build secure, scalable systems. Compliance and legal functions ensure regulations and contracts are met, risk managers anticipate and mitigate emerging threats within acceptable boundaries, and both internal and external audit update their programmes to include algorithm audits, data governance checks, bias and fairness testing, explainability reviews, cybersecurity controls, and assurance that human-in-the-loop oversight is maintained. Agile practices must also be embedded to adapt quickly to regulatory changes and emerging risks. Together, these roles create a unified governance framework that turns AI into a responsibly managed strategic asset driving innovation while staying within agreed risk parameters. AI exists across a spectrum of capability. At the foundational level is \u2018Narrow AI\u2019, systems built for a single purpose, such as Siri or Alexa handling voice commands, Netflix\u2019s recommendation engine tailoring content, or spam filters protecting email inboxes. A step further is \u2018Advanced Narrow AI\u2019, which remains domain-specific but demonstrates remarkable sophistication. Examples include ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Perplexity AI, China\u2019s ERNIE Bot, and DeepSeek. These systems can generate text, summarize documents, translate languages, assist with coding; enable computer vision for autonomous vehicles; and power scientific tools like AlphaFold for protein structure prediction. Beyond these practical applications lies \u2018General AI (AGI)\u2019, still hypothetical, which would mirror human cognitive flexibility, an AI capable of designing buildings, managing finances, and learning new skills without retraining. Some multi-modal AI systems (combining text, image, audio, and video) and agent-based architectures are moving toward AGI-like behaviour, but they remain domain-constrained. The ultimate frontier is \u2018Super AI\u2019 (ASI, with even post-ASI possibilities), a theoretical stage where machines surpass human intelligence entirely, a theoretical stage where machines surpass human intelligence entirely, innovating and governing at scales beyond human comprehension.

Speaking to The Daily Morning , Deputy subject Minister, Aravinda Senarath noted that officials had no prior experience or data to anticipate the scale of rainfall brought by Cyclone Ditwah , with several areas receiving more than 500 millimetres (mm) within a short period. \u201cIt will take some time to adjust the irrigation system to match this level of rainfall, but we hope to take the necessary steps in the short term. Plans include launching new irrigation projects and modifying existing structures so that they can endure similar conditions in the future.\" He said that it was the country's reservoirs and irrigation network that prevented much greater damage during the natural disasters caused by Cyclone Ditwah . \u201cIf the irrigation system and these reservoirs were not there, the water would have flowed through rivers, causing far more destruction. Our system helped to control the disaster to some extent,\u201d he said. However, he added that Districts such as Trincomalee and Badulla faced rainfall levels that they could no longer manage with the current infrastructure. \"Discussions are taking place with the Mahaweli Authority and other agencies to strengthen the network and improve its resilience.\"  Sri Lanka\u2019s irrigation system is among the oldest in Asia, with ancient kings constructing vast reservoirs such as Minneriya, the Kala Wewa, and the Parakrama Samudraya. These interconnected tanks created one of the world\u2019s earliest hydraulic civilisations, storing and distributing water during dry periods and supporting agriculture. Many of these ancient structures remain in operation, continuing to protect communities and farmland.  Modern expansions, including the Mahaweli Development Programme, further strengthened the system by diverting rivers, creating new reservoirs, and opening up more agricultural land. Projects such as Victoria, Kotmale, and Randenigala have played a major role in flood control, hydropower generation, and irrigation across the dry zone. Cyclone Ditwah , however, placed unprecedented pressure on both historical and modern structures. Water levels rose rapidly in several reservoirs, and spillways had to be opened to prevent structural risk.

Speaking to The Daily Morning , Deputy subject Minister, Aravinda Senarath noted that officials had no prior experience or data to anticipate the scale of rainfall brought by Cyclone Ditwah , with several areas receiving more than 500 millimetres mm within a short period. It will take some time to adjust the irrigation system to match this level of rainfall, but we hope to take the necessary steps in the short term. Plans include launching new irrigation projects and modifying existing structures so that they can endure similar conditions in the future. He said that it was the countrys reservoirs and irrigation network that prevented much greater damage during the natural disasters caused by Cyclone Ditwah . If the irrigation system and these reservoirs were not there, the water would have flowed through rivers, causing far more destruction. Our system helped to control the disaster to some extent, he said. However, he added that Districts such as Trincomalee and Badulla faced rainfall levels that they could no longer manage with the current infrastructure. Discussions are taking place with the Mahaweli Authority and other agencies to strengthen the network and improve its resilience. Sri Lankas irrigation system is among the oldest in Asia, with ancient kings constructing vast reservoirs such as Minneriya, the Kala Wewa, and the Parakrama Samudraya. These interconnected tanks created one of the worlds earliest hydraulic civilisations, storing and distributing water during dry periods and supporting agriculture. Many of these ancient structures remain in operation, continuing to protect communities and farmland. Modern expansions, including the Mahaweli Development Programme, further strengthened the system by diverting rivers, creating new reservoirs, and opening up more agricultural land. Projects such as Victoria, Kotmale, and Randenigala have played a major role in flood control, hydropower generation, and irrigation across the dry zone. Cyclone Ditwah , however, placed unprecedented pressure on both historical and modern structures. Water levels rose rapidly in several reservoirs, and spillways had to be opened to prevent structural risk.

Dr. Chandradasa also highlighted that Sri Lanka has endured numerous natural disasters and difficult experiences in the past, and that it was the unity, courage, and resilience of the people that enabled the country to recover each time. He further stated On this occasion, a major disaster occurred due to the floods and Cyclone Ditwah. After such an event, people may experience intense sadness, a sense of emptiness, disbelief, shock, and a lack of interest in daily activities. If you are suffering due to this disaster, remember that everyone in Sri Lanka stands ready to support you. Therefore, dont give up on your efforts or hopes for the future. Even if you have lost your home or a family member, dont lose hope.

The highest volume of water in history entered the Kotmale Reservoir on 27 November of this year (2025) and the spill gates were opened scientifically according to the standard procedure in order to protect the Kotmale Dam, officials have stated. This was conveyed when President Anura Kumara Dissanayake questioned the relevant officials about various opinions circulating in the country regarding the said Reservoir and the opening of the spill gates due to the adverse weather conditions. A special District Coordinating Committee (DCC) meeting to review the damage to irrigation channels in the said District and the urgent measures required was held yesterday (08) at the said District Secretariat (DS). Officials further stated that 4,700 acres of paddy fields in the District had been damaged and that apart from 500 acres, the remaining paddy fields could be cultivated during the Maha Season. At the DCC meeting convened yesterday to review the damage caused to the agricultural sector in the said District due to Cyclone Ditwah and to discuss the urgent measures required, it was revealed that due to the adverse weather conditions, a total of 1,421 hectares (ha) of vegetable cultivation has been damaged. President Dissanayake has instructed the relevant officials to take the necessary measures to provide compensation to farmers without delay. Officials stated that although there has been crop damage, the reduction in the vegetable harvest in the District would be around 25%. They added the District would be able to meet the supply of the daily demand, but that a decrease in the daily demand has been observed. Officials further pointed out to the President the reason for the decline is the spread of false information claiming a vegetable shortage in the District and that prices have been excessively increased. Meanwhile, President Dissanayake instructed officials to assign supervision and technical services related to the Gregory Lake to the Department and to enter into an agreement with the Municipal Council regarding economic activities. A discussion on reviewing the damage caused to roads in the said District and the urgent measures required to repair them was held yesterday at the said DS. Lengthy discussions were held regarding all roads damaged in the District due to Ditwah, as well as the time required to repair them. The President has also called for a report to be submitted on the roads that cannot be reopened through standard repairs. Officials also pointed out that reports from the National Building Research Organisation should be taken into consideration when constructing certain roads and bridges in the said District. Accordingly, the President instructed officials to release the necessary provisions promptly for the repair of damaged roads, culverts and retaining walls in the District and to take steps to complete all repair work before the end of 2025.

The SC made the remarks in a Fundamental Rights (FR) case filed by V.A.A. Vithana Arachchi, who complained that he had been subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by Police officers attached to the Thalathuoya Police Station, and later arrested without lawful basis in April 2019. The petition, filed on 5 October 2020, named four officers from the said Station, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), and the Attorney General as respondents.  A bench comprising Justices Arjuna Obeyesekere, K. Priyantha Fernando, and M. Sampath K.B. Wijeratne considered the petition. Leave to proceed had been granted in February 2022 with respect to alleged violations of Articles 11, 12(1), and 13(1) of the Constitution, which safeguard citizens against torture and cruel treatment, guarantee equality before the law, and prohibit arrest except in accordance with legal procedure. In its judgment, the SC noted that Article 11\u2019s absolute protection against degrading treatment had been breached, and declared that the petitioner\u2019s FRs under Articles 11 and 12(1) had been violated by the first and second respondent officers from the said Station. The SC reiterated that Police brutality \u201cin whatever form and in whatever degree must stop\u201d, adding that previous judgments had \u201cfallen on deaf ears\u201d, referring to both the IGP and the National Police Commission (NPC). The SC ruled that although persons suspected of offences must be dealt with according to the law, complaints consistently show that suspects are assaulted or mistreated the moment that they are taken into Police custody. \u201cWhatever may be the circumstances that lead to an arrest, every citizen is entitled to be treated with the dignity that goes with being human,\u201d the judgment stated.  The ruling comes at a time when the Public Security Ministry has acknowledged a long-standing decline in discipline within the Police force. Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala recently said the Government had suspended between 50 and 60 officers over misconduct, including incidents of assault, deaths in custody, and unlawful detentions. Wijepala said that investigations are underway into every complaint, with action taken more firmly than ever before. However, he noted that addressing longstanding issues in the Police requires more complex processes than in other institutions. \u201cTransfers or appointments cannot be made simply through a Cabinet paper.

Meanwhile, considering the irrigation systems under the Department, the spill gates have been opened in nearly 30 major reservoirs including Rajanganaya, Deduru Oya, Nachchaduwa, Senanayake Samudraya, Weheragala and Lunugamvehera to gradually reduce the water levels.

He further stated that with forecasts predicting rainfall in the coming days, the public should remain attentive, and that the Department will continue to provide updates on the evolving situation. Elsewhere, the Department has taken urgent measures to restore canals and reservoirs damaged by the floods caused by Cyclone Ditwah , aiming to resume the water supply to paddy fields and other cultivation lands.\u00a0Sooriyabandara stated that temporary restorations have already been begun to protect the severely affected paddy fields.

Minister Anura Jayasekara, Parliamentarian Ashoka Ranwala, the Biyagama Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) Chairperson Lal Kumarapeli, and a private company jointly initiated the project. The Biyagama area suffered extensive damage due to the flooding, and the main challenge faced by the displaced residents upon returning to their homes was the strong odour caused by the delay in clearing the garbage piled up along the roadsides. The initiative was launched as an immediate solution to address this issue.

The unveiling signals the completion of Unity Plaza\u2019s ambitious redevelopment journey that began with its relaunch in November 2023. The towering triple-faced display, visible from Galle Road, Wellawatta and Station Road, elevates the building into one of the most striking digital structures in the country.

He noted that while Sri Lanka went through a prolonged period of turbulence between 2018 and 2023, the country now stands out for having regained both political and economic stability; conditions he described as the most critical prerequisites for sustained investor interest. Desai said he increased the Fund\u2019s allocation to Sri Lanka soon after visiting the country in November 2022, at what he noted as the \u201cbottom\u201d of the crisis. \u201cValuations at that time were among the cheapest in the region, with the market trading at roughly four times forward earnings,\u201d he said, adding that, since then, the AFC Asia Frontier Fund has made Sri Lanka its second-largest country allocation, benefitting from both rising prices and a deliberate increase in exposure due to improving macro fundamentals. \u201cFor the first time in many years, Sri Lanka has both economic and political stability. The platform is set for stable growth over the next three to four years, provided this stability holds,\u201d he stressed. He acknowledged the recent natural disaster as a temporary setback, but insisted markets are forward-looking and Sri Lanka has already faced and recovered from worse shocks in recent years. Desai argued that despite a strong 2.5-year market recovery, Sri Lankan equities remain undervalued relative to their fundamentals and regional peers. The broader market trades at around 11 times earnings, below the 14-16 times price-to-earnings ratio seen in 2014-2016, when foreign investor presence was far stronger. \u201cCompany fundamentals, however, have largely returned to pre-crisis strength. Earnings growth is robust across the banking, consumer, and industrial sectors, return on equity levels have normalised, and private sector banks are benefitting directly from improved credit growth and macro stability,\u201d he pointed out. He compared Commercial Bank of Ceylon with Vietnam\u2019s largest commercial bank Vietcom Bank to illustrate the valuation gap. \u201cCommercial Bank trades at around one-time book value, while the comparable Vietnamese bank trades at nearly 2.5 times, yet Sri Lankan banks show stronger earnings momentum.\u201d In consumer markets too, Desai said companies such as Sunshine Holdings demonstrate earnings strength comparable to leading regional consumer giants but still trade at modest multiples. Although foreign participation in the Colombo Stock Exchange remains sharply lower than a decade ago\u2014now between 5% and 10% of daily turnover compared to nearly 50% in some years before 2018\u2014Desai noted this is part of a global trend, not just a Sri Lankan issue, with investors shifting towards US markets as the S&P 500 and major tech stocks delivered exceptional returns over the past decade. However, he believes foreign interest could return as macro fundamentals strengthen and stability persists. \u201cIf not in 2025, then by 2026 or 2027, you could see foreign funds coming back,\u201d he expressed confidence. He also emphasised that Sri Lanka cannot rely solely on foreign capital and must deepen domestic investor participation, which remains low. Only 11\u201312% of unit trust assets under management are in equities, far below levels seen in India or Vietnam. Desai highlighted several long-term strengths that continue to position Sri Lanka favourably. \u201cStrong corporate governance and transparency, making company access and information far easier than in many frontier markets; resilient pool of well-run companies with strong brands and decades of operational history; and untapped structural sectors, including logistics and tourism, where arrivals of 2.2\u20132.3 million remain far below regional comparators such as Cambodia,\u201d he explained. He also pointed out that Sri Lanka\u2019s market-cap-to-GDP ratio of roughly 25% is low relative to countries with more developed capital markets, suggesting significant room for expansion as equity participation deepens.

Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Desai said he has tracked Sri Lankas market since 2014, alongside other frontier and emerging markets such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, and Georgia. He noted that while Sri Lanka went through a prolonged period of turbulence between 2018 and 2023, the country now stands out for having regained both political and economic stability conditions he described as the most critical prerequisites for sustained investor interest. Desai said he increased the Funds allocation to Sri Lanka soon after visiting the country in November 2022, at what he noted as the bottom of the crisis. Valuations at that time were among the cheapest in the region, with the market trading at roughly four times forward earnings, he said, adding that, since then, the AFC Asia Frontier Fund has made Sri Lanka its second-largest country allocation, benefitting from both rising prices and a deliberate increase in exposure due to improving macro fundamentals. For the first time in many years, Sri Lanka has both economic and political stability. The platform is set for stable growth over the next three to four years, provided this stability holds, he stressed. He acknowledged the recent natural disaster as a temporary setback, but insisted markets are forward-looking and Sri Lanka has already faced and recovered from worse shocks in recent years. Desai argued that despite a strong 2.5-year market recovery, Sri Lankan equities remain undervalued relative to their fundamentals and regional peers. The broader market trades at around 11 times earnings, below the 14-16 times price-to-earnings ratio seen in 2014-2016, when foreign investor presence was far stronger. Company fundamentals, however, have largely returned to pre-crisis strength. Earnings growth is robust across the banking, consumer, and industrial sectors, return on equity levels have normalised, and private sector banks are benefitting directly from improved credit growth and macro stability, he pointed out. He compared Commercial Bank of Ceylon with Vietnams largest commercial bank Vietcom Bank to illustrate the valuation gap. Commercial Bank trades at around one-time book value, while the comparable Vietnamese bank trades at nearly 2.5 times, yet Sri Lankan banks show stronger earnings momentum. In consumer markets too, Desai said companies such as Sunshine Holdings demonstrate earnings strength comparable to leading regional consumer giants but still trade at modest multiples. Although foreign participation in the Colombo Stock Exchange remains sharply lower than a decade agonow between 5 and 10 of daily turnover compared to nearly 50 in some years before 2018Desai noted this is part of a global trend, not just a Sri Lankan issue, with investors shifting towards US markets as the SP 500 and major tech stocks delivered exceptional returns over the past decade. However, he believes foreign interest could return as macro fundamentals strengthen and stability persists. If not in 2025, then by 2026 or 2027, you could see foreign funds coming back, he expressed confidence. He also emphasised that Sri Lanka cannot rely solely on foreign capital and must deepen domestic investor participation, which remains low. Only 1112 of unit trust assets under management are in equities, far below levels seen in India or Vietnam. Desai highlighted several long-term strengths that continue to position Sri Lanka favourably. Strong corporate governance and transparency, making company access and information far easier than in many frontier markets resilient pool of well-run companies with strong brands and decades of operational history and untapped structural sectors, including logistics and tourism, where arrivals of 2.22.3 million remain far below regional comparators such as Cambodia, he explained. He also pointed out that Sri Lankas market-cap-to-GDP ratio of roughly 25 is low relative to countries with more developed capital markets, suggesting significant room for expansion as equity participation deepens. Desai said Sri Lanka will remain a high-conviction market for the AFC Asia Frontier Fund for the next several years. Its one of my top country picks. Weve been right about Sri Lanka for the past 2.5 years, and I remain very positive for the next two to three years. From here, its up to the country not to drop the ball, he added. With stability restored, earnings strong, and valuations still attractive, he reiterated that Sri Lanka is well-positioned to deliver continued market outperformance, provided reforms stay on track and confidence remains intact.

Vimalenthirarajah\u00a0\u2013 Pic by Upul Abayasekara By Charumini de Silva The Trade, Commerce and Food Security Ministry is preparing to introduce a comprehensive national tariff policy by mid-2026, replacing what officials described as decades of \u201cpatchwork, sector-specific, and discriminatory\u201d protection that has suppressed competitiveness, discouraged entrepreneurship, and hindered integration into global value chains. Ministry Secretary K.A. Vimalenthirarajah speaking during a panel discussion at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday said the overhaul will mark a decisive shift away from a revenue-driven, protectionist tariff structure towards a transparent, predictable, and facilitative regime aligned with global trade norms. He stressed that the existing system, identified by the World Bank as one of the most complex in the world, has created unpredictability, high production costs, and limited the ability of local industries to compete regionally. He said the Government has now identified 10 core objectives and principles for the new policy, with four central pillars guiding the reform. The first is establishing predictability and consistency in the tariff regime, addressing longstanding complaints of ad-hoc changes and opaque decision-making. The second is simplification, with the new system designed to dramatically reduce complexity and remove the maze of para-tariffs and overlapping duties. The third is a shift from protection to \u201ctime-bound facilitation,\u201d ensuring that any support extended to infant industries is targeted, transparent, and temporary. The fourth is enabling global and regional value chain participation by lowering input costs and ensuring timely access to raw materials, intermediate goods, and capital goods. \u201cTariffs cannot be the panacea for every problem. For decades, they have distorted our entrepreneurship ecosystem,\u201d Vimalenthirarajah said, adding that the current structure has discouraged new entrants while forcing existing firms to rely on protection instead of productivity and innovation. He noted that the new regime will help transform Sri Lanka\u2019s inward-looking Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) into export-oriented enterprises and strengthen diversification efforts outlined by the Export Development Board (EDB). \u201cThe Cabinet has already approved the establishment of a National Tariff Committee and a Ministerial Tariff Committee, both of which are working towards finalising the new framework,\u201d he said. According to Vimalenthirarajah, the entire system is expected to be operational by the middle of next year, marking one of the most significant trade reforms in recent decades. He also underscored that the tariff overhaul is inseparable from Sri Lanka\u2019s broader trade agenda, particularly ongoing reviews of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and the country\u2019s renewed push to expand market access. \u201cA Cabinet-appointed committee is currently reassessing existing FTAs to develop a technically sound national strategy, including diversification into Asian, African, and Middle Eastern markets,\u201d he added. He also confirmed that Sri Lanka has received an invitation to join the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) following earlier requests, a move the Government is evaluating against long-term strategic interests. The Secretary emphasised that FTAs must be understood correctly: tariff reductions take place in staged phases, often over 15 to 20 years, and require extensive compliance with rules of origin, Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) protocols, and other regulatory standards. Vimalenthirarajah warned that misconceptions have slowed national progress, even though Sri Lanka benefits from multiple concessionary market access schemes that remain underutilised due to limited export depth. Responding to questions on using mineral resources in negotiations and addressing non-tariff barriers, he noted that Sri Lanka is stepping up engagement with the US and other partners to reduce such obstacles. He said global tariff averages are falling, making non-tariff barriers increasingly influential in determining competitiveness. As part of its reforms, Sri Lanka will accelerate the implementation of World Trade Organisation (WTO)-aligned protocols, aiming to complete the remaining 14 intellectual property-related agreements within three years. He added that the Single Window project and broader trade facilitation reforms will address bottlenecks in Customs approvals and compliance, ensuring Sri Lanka becomes a \u201ccompliant, predictable, and investment-friendly\u201d economy. Stating that Sri Lanka \u201ccannot afford to stand alone,\u201d Vimalenthirarajah said the Government is committed to regional integration and will pursue FTAs and economic partnerships that support investment flows, diversification, and export growth.

This marks a significant milestone as Assetline Finance enters the listed debt capital market for the first time, reflecting confidence in its growth trajectory and a strategic focus on funding diversification, liquidity and long-term financial resilience. The Colombo Stock Exchange has approved the listing of 50 million debentures, each with a face value of Rs. 100 each and a tenor of five years. The issue has received a preliminary \u2018A\u2019 rating with a Positive Outlook from Lanka Rating Agency, highlighting Assetline Finance\u2019s creditworthiness, robust capital position, prudent risk management, and ability to navigate evolving market conditions. The issuance underscores the company\u2019s operating stability, sound financial profile, and readiness to leverage capital markets to support sustained growth. Investors are offered attractive annual and semi-annual interest options designed to deliver competitive risk-adjusted returns while supporting Assetline Finance\u2019s balanced funding strategy. Proceeds from the issue are earmarked for expanding the company\u2019s lending portfolio, supporting product innovation, and strengthening its funding base, enabling greater value creation across customer segments and contributing to national economic activity through increased credit access. Assetline Finance enters this capital market initiative with a strengthened and increasingly resilient financial performance for the first half of FY25/26 with total assets rising to Rs. 72,712 million, nearly 40% growth driven by lending expansion and improved asset quality. Interest income reached Rs. 6,732 million and net interest income Rs. 4,826 million, supported by strong traction in core operations Profitability indicators demonstrated meaningful improvement, with profit before tax rising to Rs. 2,940 million and profit after tax reaching Rs. 1,416 million, underpinned by efficient collections, strengthened underwriting controls, and enhanced operating efficiency. The lending portfolio grew by 42% to Rs. 60,651 million, during the first half of FY25/26, driven by strong demand across SME, micro-enterprise, and mobility-based segments, while equity strengthened to Rs. 17,154 million, further reinforcing its capacity for expansion. Asset quality demonstrated continued improvement, with the Gross Stage 3 Loan Ratio improved to 4% from 9.7% a year earlier, while the Net Stage 3 Ratio improved to 1.8% from 6.4%.

Delivering the keynote at the \u2018Investment Point of View\u2019 session of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, he said the country\u2019s hard-won stability now provides a crucial opening to lift public investment, strengthen competitiveness, and scale islands of excellence in high-value sectors. \u201cFiscal consolidation must not be seen as an end in itself, but as the foundation for long-term development, serving to unlock infrastructure expansion, exports, and productivity-driven growth,\u201d he stressed. He noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery from the crisis is built on measurable gains, including a current account surplus, exceeding International Monetary Fund (IMF) targets for the primary surplus, and a projected decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio to below 95%, ahead of the IMF\u2019s 2032 timeline. However, he cautioned that maintaining this trajectory is essential for foreign and domestic investor confidence, particularly as the State cannot finance the country\u2019s development priorities alone. \u201cProgress achieved so far must now be followed by deeper reforms to improve the overall business environment,\u201d he added. He pointed to the power sector as a critical example, where unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) under the broader State-owned enterprise (SOE) restructuring agenda signals improved governance and the potential to attract investment into renewable energy. He opined that Sri Lanka will require close to $ 11 billion by 2030 to meet its climate and net-zero commitments, and that predictable power purchase agreements, transparent pricing, and adherence to global environmental and governance standards are essential to draw long-term institutional capital. He added that the World Bank Group, including the IFC, is supporting these efforts through guarantees, risk-sharing tools, and instruments designed to de-risk both equity and debt investments in the real economy. Fakhoury underscored the need to level the playing field for both domestic and foreign investors, particularly in areas such as land access and sectoral ownership restrictions. He called for stronger Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) financing, highlighting a gap equivalent to 20% of GDP, and urged swift operationalisation of the new Secured Transactions Act to unlock credit for small businesses, including women-led enterprises. Additional reforms in competition policy, labour laws, trade facilitation, and public sector governance, he said, are necessary to drive investment, enhance transparency, and reduce the costs of doing business. Fakhoury said the direction outlined in the 2026 Budget, placing private sector-led growth at the centre, reflects an essential shift. But he noted that consistent policy, minimal reversals, and rapid implementation of the Economic Transformation Act\u2019s key elements, including the public-private partnership (PPP), insolvency and investment protection laws, will determine whether Sri Lanka can scale investment and achieve durable growth. He identified renewable energy, logistics, export-oriented industries, digital services, specialised manufacturing, agribusiness, and high-value tourism as the sectors with the strongest potential to propel Sri Lanka towards its ambition of 7% annual GDP expansion. He noted that the Colombo Port\u2019s role as a critical transshipment hub can be further strengthened by focusing on efficient port operations, expanding logistics and supply chain services, and maximising port capacity to attract global investment. \u201cSri Lanka must shift decisively from an inward-focused model to an export-driven strategy through new free trade agreements (FTAs), modernised tariff policies, and smoother trade facilitation,\u201d he stressed. Highlighting that the country already hosts high-performing \u201cislands of excellence\u201d in specialised manufacturing, digital services, and niche agribusinesses, he said these should be scaled through expanded Board of Investment (BOI) and sector-specific zones, improved digital infrastructure, better STEM skills, and strong branding for premium agro-products. Fakhoury said Sri Lanka possesses all attributes needed to become one of Asia\u2019s premier destinations. To reach the goal of $ 8 billion in annual earnings and 4 million visitors, he called for a destination management framework that elevates high-value segments such as wellness, Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE), surfing, and nature-based tourism, while improving connectivity and development in the island\u2019s east and north. \u201cThe partnerships and consensus emerging from the two-day summit reflect a shared recognition that Sri Lanka\u2019s future should not be defined merely by resilience, but by competitive excellence,\u201d he said. He reiterated that the World Bank Group and IFC stand ready to support the private and public sectors as the country seeks to consolidate its recovery, accelerate investment, and position itself as a gateway to regional opportunity. \u201cSri Lanka can achieve much more than stabilisation. It can transform,\u201d he said, urging State institutions and businesses to work \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d to turn renewed confidence into sustained, job-creating growth.

He noted that Sri Lankas recovery from the crisis is built on measurable gains, including a current account surplus, exceeding International Monetary Fund IMF targets for the primary surplus, and a projected decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio to below 95, ahead of the IMFs 2032 timeline. However, he cautioned that maintaining this trajectory is essential for foreign and domestic investor confidence, particularly as the State cannot finance the countrys development priorities alone. Progress achieved so far must now be followed by deeper reforms to improve the overall business environment, he added. He pointed to the power sector as a critical example, where unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board CEB under the broader State-owned enterprise SOE restructuring agenda signals improved governance and the potential to attract investment into renewable energy. He opined that Sri Lanka will require close to  11 billion by 2030 to meet its climate and net-zero commitments, and that predictable power purchase agreements, transparent pricing, and adherence to global environmental and governance standards are essential to draw long-term institutional capital. He added that the World Bank Group, including the IFC, is supporting these efforts through guarantees, risk-sharing tools, and instruments designed to de-risk both equity and debt investments in the real economy. Fakhoury underscored the need to level the playing field for both domestic and foreign investors, particularly in areas such as land access and sectoral ownership restrictions. He called for stronger Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise MSME financing, highlighting a gap equivalent to 20 of GDP, and urged swift operationalisation of the new Secured Transactions Act to unlock credit for small businesses, including women-led enterprises. Additional reforms in competition policy, labour laws, trade facilitation, and public sector governance, he said, are necessary to drive investment, enhance transparency, and reduce the costs of doing business. Fakhoury said the direction outlined in the 2026 Budget, placing private sector-led growth at the centre, reflects an essential shift. But he noted that consistent policy, minimal reversals, and rapid implementation of the Economic Transformation Acts key elements, including the public-private partnership PPP, insolvency and investment protection laws, will determine whether Sri Lanka can scale investment and achieve durable growth. He identified renewable energy, logistics, export-oriented industries, digital services, specialised manufacturing, agribusiness, and high-value tourism as the sectors with the strongest potential to propel Sri Lanka towards its ambition of 7 annual GDP expansion. He noted that the Colombo Ports role as a critical transshipment hub can be further strengthened by focusing on efficient port operations, expanding logistics and supply chain services, and maximising port capacity to attract global investment. Sri Lanka must shift decisively from an inward-focused model to an export-driven strategy through new free trade agreements FTAs, modernised tariff policies, and smoother trade facilitation, he stressed. Highlighting that the country already hosts high-performing islands of excellence in specialised manufacturing, digital services, and niche agribusinesses, he said these should be scaled through expanded Board of Investment BOI and sector-specific zones, improved digital infrastructure, better STEM skills, and strong branding for premium agro-products. Fakhoury said Sri Lanka possesses all attributes needed to become one of Asias premier destinations. To reach the goal of  8 billion in annual earnings and 4 million visitors, he called for a destination management framework that elevates high-value segments such as wellness, Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions MICE, surfing, and nature-based tourism, while improving connectivity and development in the islands east and north. The partnerships and consensus emerging from the two-day summit reflect a shared recognition that Sri Lankas future should not be defined merely by resilience, but by competitive excellence, he said. He reiterated that the World Bank Group and IFC stand ready to support the private and public sectors as the country seeks to consolidate its recovery, accelerate investment, and position itself as a gateway to regional opportunity. Sri Lanka can achieve much more than stabilisation. It can transform, he said, urging State institutions and businesses to work shoulder to shoulder to turn renewed confidence into sustained, job-creating growth.

Presenting the latest sector overview, the EDB Chairman Mangala Wijesinghe noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s exports had remained stagnant between $ 13\u201315 billion for nearly a decade. However, recent policy reforms, revived advisory structures, and performance-based targets for industries and overseas missions are now driving a stronger growth trajectory. Despite global economic uncertainty, the EDB stated that Sri Lanka is on course to surpass $ 16\u201317 billion in exports this year, one of the strongest performances in recent years. The Board emphasised that continued reforms, enhanced market access, and deeper collaboration between government and industry will be critical as the country advances toward its next milestone of $ 20 billion in export earnings. Wijesinghe said the EDB is working across all districts to enhance product competitiveness and market access while providing more targeted assistance for SMEs, who represent 78% of exporters but contribute only a limited share to total export revenue. Strengthening their participation is considered a national priority, with regional development programs and improved support services set to significantly increase their contribution. The meeting also revealed that Sri Lanka is preparing to host a major international industrial exhibition aimed at attracting high-value global buyers and investors. Officials expressed confidence that such initiatives would further elevate the country\u2019s export presence. Deputy Minister Prof. Ruwan Ranasinghe, along with MPs Sujeewa Senasinghe, K. Sujith Sanjaya Perera, Chathura Galappaththi, Dr. Sellaththamby Thilaganathan, Chaminda Hettiarachchi, Nishantha Jayaweera, Chandana Sooriyaarachchi, Thilina Samarakoon and EDB officials, took part in the discussions.

In a special statement issued, he detailed the latest progress of the Government\u2019s \u2018Rebuilding Sri Lanka\u2019 Fund and the wider restoration effort underway across the country. Providing the first financial update since the official donation channels were activated, Dr. Suriyapperuma said the Bank of Ceylon\u2019s dedicated account has received over Rs. 635 million from more than 30,470 individual deposits within just a few days. Accounts set up at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) have attracted over Rs. 61 million, bringing the total to over Rs. 697.4 million. \u201cDonations have flowed in from Sri Lankans and well-wishers from 33 countries, with the highest contributions recorded from France, followed by Canada, the US, Italy, and South Korea. We are really appreciative of both individuals as well as collective efforts to support Sri Lanka\u2019s rebuilding journey,\u201d he said. Dr. Suriyapperuma said the outpouring of support from local agencies, international partners and Sri Lankans overseas has been overwhelming. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of compassion and support from everyone involved in the process,\u201d he said, noting increasing requests from organisations and individuals seeking to assist with both recovery and long-term rebuilding. Customs house agents and trade associations have volunteered to expedite the clearance of relief shipments arriving from overseas. \u201cThese goods will be cleared and handed over to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), which will coordinate sending them to the people in need at the earliest possible,\u201d he said. With rescue operations winding down, he said the Government has now shifted focus to reopening access between cut-off areas, clearing debris, and restoring basic connectivity. \u201cVehicles can start moving between the areas that were cut off due to landslides and other destruction. The cleaning up exercise and removal of debris are being carried out with significant facilitation from many Government agencies,\u201d he added. The Treasury Secretary also confirmed that multilateral assistance is already being mobilised. The World Bank has begun the Rapid Post-Disaster Damage Assessment, which is expected to be completed within two weeks. \u201cData is imperative. It will enable the Government and other agencies to work with more information at hand,\u201d he noted, adding that the Finance Ministry, the DMC, and the national task force led by the Sri Lanka Customs Director General are coordinating the process. As Sri Lanka prepares for the next phase, Dr. Suriyapperuma said Government agencies are working to restore essential services including electricity, water, telecommunications, and road access, while clearing damaged schools, hospitals, and public buildings to allow displaced families in temporary shelters to return home as soon as possible. He stressed the importance of coordinated national action. \u201cCitizens, individuals, corporates, and both Government and non-Government agencies have come forward to assist. That coordinated mechanism is allowing the Government to reach people in need as early as possible,\u201d he pointed out. Dr. Suriyapperuma said the Treasury will continue to release regular updates as the rebuilding effort progresses, whilst thanking all contributors for supporting the country at what he described as a \u2018pivotal moment in Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery.\u2019    Editorial : +94 0112 479 356 ,  +94 0112 479 780 +94 0112 447 848 Technical : +94 011 247 9437 helpdesk@wijeya.lk webadsupport@wijeya.lk Marketing : +94 011 247 9540 +94 011 247 9873 Web Advertising Inquiry : Dilan : +94 77 372 7288 Print Advertising : Chameen Dayarathne, Manager - Marketing, : 076 928 5885 / 011 247 9597 : chameend@wijeya.lk Mr Channa Jayasinghe, Marketing Manager & Sales, : +94 777 880 155 : channaj@wijeya.lk All the content on this website is copyright protected and can be reproduced only by giving the due courtesy to 'ft.lk' Copyright \ufffd 2004 Wijeya Newspapers Ltd.

We are really appreciative of both individuals as well as collective efforts to support Sri Lankas rebuilding journey, he said. Dr. Suriyapperuma said the outpouring of support from local agencies, international partners and Sri Lankans overseas has been overwhelming. Theres a lot of compassion and support from everyone involved in the process, he said, noting increasing requests from organisations and individuals seeking to assist with both recovery and long-term rebuilding. Customs house agents and trade associations have volunteered to expedite the clearance of relief shipments arriving from overseas. These goods will be cleared and handed over to the Disaster Management Centre DMC, which will coordinate sending them to the people in need at the earliest possible, he said. With rescue operations winding down, he said the Government has now shifted focus to reopening access between cut-off areas, clearing debris, and restoring basic connectivity. Vehicles can start moving between the areas that were cut off due to landslides and other destruction. The cleaning up exercise and removal of debris are being carried out with significant facilitation from many Government agencies, he added. The Treasury Secretary also confirmed that multilateral assistance is already being mobilised. The World Bank has begun the Rapid Post-Disaster Damage Assessment, which is expected to be completed within two weeks. Data is imperative. It will enable the Government and other agencies to work with more information at hand, he noted, adding that the Finance Ministry, the DMC, and the national task force led by the Sri Lanka Customs Director General are coordinating the process. As Sri Lanka prepares for the next phase, Dr. Suriyapperuma said Government agencies are working to restore essential services including electricity, water, telecommunications, and road access, while clearing damaged schools, hospitals, and public buildings to allow displaced families in temporary shelters to return home as soon as possible. He stressed the importance of coordinated national action. Citizens, individuals, corporates, and both Government and non-Government agencies have come forward to assist. That coordinated mechanism is allowing the Government to reach people in need as early as possible, he pointed out. Dr. Suriyapperuma said the Treasury will continue to release regular updates as the rebuilding effort progresses, whilst thanking all contributors for supporting the country at what he described as a pivotal moment in Sri Lankas recovery.

It was noted that ahead of the rollout, a detailed briefing will be conducted in January for MPs outlining eligible sectors, operational procedures, and the mechanisms for applicants to access the loans. Handunneththi also announced the establishment of a National Database for Industrialists, designed to consolidate information on all industrial stakeholders under one system. Ministry officials said a nationwide promotional campaign will encourage entrepreneurs to register, enabling easier access to Government services, support schemes, and industry-related facilitation. The Committee also discussed extending collateral-free loan facilities to craftsmen registered with the National Crafts Council, with several members highlighting its potential to expand the country\u2019s craft sector and support micro-level industry revival. Officials from the National Paper Company Ltd., briefed the committee on improvements at the State-run paper mill. Following corrective measures taken in recent months, the mill has increased monthly output substantially from a previous 150-180 tons to 400 tons, marking a significant turnaround in production capacity. The Minister also presented details of a newly developed National Advisory Framework for issuing excavation permits. Aimed at replacing the current fragmented and inconsistent system, the framework seeks to introduce uniform guidelines and a streamlined approval process.

The relief scheme adds fiscal pressure at a time when the Treasury is attempting to consolidate public finances under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. But the Government has signalled that immediate stabilisation of disaster-affected areas takes precedence, with financing routed mainly through the Defence Ministry and implemented via Divisional Secretariats nationwide. Although the Circular does not indicate the total fiscal outlay, the scale of payments suggests a significant expenditure at a time when the Government is attempting to rebuild confidence following 2022\u2019s external debt standstill. On Friday, President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake addressing Parliament said the Government would submit a Rs. 50 billion supplementary estimate for immediate relief spending for 2025 and a separate Rs. 500 billion for 2026. He said that a request has been made to the IMF to allow the country to access $ 200 million from special drawing rights. The IMF was also requested that the next $ 347 million tranche under the External Fund Facility (EFF) due later this month to be increased. The recent measures, set out in the Finance Ministry Budget Circular No. 08/2025 of 5 December, outline direct cash transfers, housing reconstruction grants, and sector-specific compensation for farmers, small enterprises, and fishing communities. According to the Circular, households will receive a one-time payment of Rs. 25,000 to clean and safely re-enter homes affected by flooding and landslides. Families whose kitchens or essential living spaces have been rendered unusable will be granted Rs. 50,000. Additional resettlement allowances are available for families requiring temporary shelter, including up to Rs. 25,000 per month for those whose homes were fully destroyed. The largest fiscal commitments relate to housing reconstruction, payments of up to Rs. 5 million, will be provided to families whose houses were completely damaged, either for rebuilding on existing land or purchasing a new plot where State land cannot be allocated. Partially damaged homes may qualify for up to Rs. 250,000, subject to on-site assessment by officials. Agriculture, one of the sectors most disrupted by the cyclone, will receive compensation for crop and livestock losses. Farmers may claim Rs. 150,000 per hectare for paddy, grains, and field crops, and Rs. 200,000 per hectare for vegetable cultivation. Registered livestock farmers will be paid Rs. 20,000 per animal lost. Small industries and micro-enterprises may receive Rs. 200,000 per unit to restore machinery and resume operations, while fishers may receive up to Rs. 400,000 for damaged vessels. The Government also announced payments of Rs. 15,000 to support schoolchildren affected by the disaster, along with Rs. 1 million to families of those who died or were rendered permanently disabled. The Finance Ministry said that the scheme must be administered with strict verification processes, referencing earlier disaster-relief circulars that govern damage assessment. The guidelines stipulate that duplicate claims are prohibited and that certain categories of relief must be adjusted to account for earlier payments made under separate disaster-relief programs. The relief package applies only to areas formally designated as disaster zones following Cyclone Ditwah, but may be used in addition to other Government assistance schemes now underway. Officials have been instructed to implement the measures immediately, with payments channelled through local administrations under Treasury oversight.

Nandalal Weerasinghe \u2013 Pic by Ruwan Walpola Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe has warned that Sri Lanka cannot afford to forget the reform agenda that underpins the country\u2019s stabilisation, even as post-Ditwah reconstruction demands immediate Government attention. Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, he said the country\u2019s foundation for growth remains fragile and depends on discipline in macroeconomic management and the timely implementation of structural reforms. \u201cThe stability that we have basically achieved is a foundation for growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen going forward, we need to ensure we maintain monetary stability, fiscal stability, and also external stability. That is important, and also financial stability. So, when going forward, for us to move into a higher growth path, we should not weaken the foundation for stability.\u201d He warned that the reform trajectory must not be derailed by the disaster response. \u201cWe should not forget that we need to focus on this area,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these short-term shocks we can absorb. I am sure the fiscal space is there. We can manage that. I am not too concerned about that.\u201d Dr. Weerasinghe said the Central Bank expects supply chain disruptions from the cyclone to cause only a brief increase in inflation. \u201cWe might see a small uptick in inflation as a result of these supply chain disruptions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is something we do not have to worry about. But that could reflect, given the real inflation environment. This 2 percent inflation going up to 3 percent will not be a surprise, given the short-term impact.\u201d He said inflation should revert once bottlenecks clear. \u201cOver a period of time, once supply chain issues are addressed, I would say we will come back to the normal inflation trajectory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will maintain stability going forward, as we have been doing so far under the framework.\u201d He also said the cyclone will not produce a major balance of payments shock. \u201cExternal impact, I do not see as a significant impact from this event,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we see is an immediate impact that will be more cyclical.\u201d Reviewing global risks, he said earlier concerns over US tariff policy had eased. \u201cWe had a lot of concerns at that point. Now we can see that it has been softening in terms of its impact on Sri Lanka as well as other markets,\u201d he said. \u201cCompared to where we were, that issue, I think, to a certain extent is again stabilising in my view.\u201d He noted that political developments and energy prices remain uncertainties, though Sri Lanka\u2019s rising reliance on renewable energy mitigates exposure to global price swings. Domestically, he said pent-up demand for agricultural imports had temporarily pushed the current account into a small deficit, but this was normalising. \u201cNow we can see that this is also settling down,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, we saw some pressure on the external side last month. Now it is gradually settling down.\u201d The CBSL Governor downplayed the impact of global interest rate changes. \u201cI do not see that as a significant impact on our balance of payments side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have much exposure to these kinds of global interest rates.\u201d However, he cautioned that disruptions in supply chains could present modest challenges for exporters. \u201cThis impact could be a small shock in terms of supply chain disruption, especially for our suppliers here,\u201d Dr. Weerasinghe said. \u201cThat we will have to manage.\u201d On medium-term growth, Dr. Weerasinghe said Sri Lanka must convert consumption-led demand into investment. Sovereign rating improvements, trade reforms and productivity gains are essential conditions, he said. \u201cI think we are hoping that there will be an improvement in this rating,\u201d he said. \u201cFacilitation through reforms, making the business environment easier through some of the reforms already included in the World Bank budget support programme, those are very important reforms.\u201d He highlighted reducing non-tariff barriers, labour productivity reforms and stronger regional integration as priorities. \u201cWe need to have important reforms implemented to improve the productivity of labour and also reduce the barriers to trade and have access to regional markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Government has made a decision to link up with RCEP. This is a very important link-up for supply chains in the region for us to have much more open trade.\u201d He closed by reiterating that stability must be actively maintained. \u201cWe will maintain stability going forward, as we have been doing so far under the framework,\u201d he said.

Nandalal Weerasinghe  Pic by Ruwan Walpola Central Bank of Sri Lanka CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe has warned that Sri Lanka cannot afford to forget the reform agenda that underpins the countrys stabilisation, even as post-Ditwah reconstruction demands immediate Government attention. Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, he said the countrys foundation for growth remains fragile and depends on discipline in macroeconomic management and the timely implementation of structural reforms. The stability that we have basically achieved is a foundation for growth, he said. When going forward, we need to ensure we maintain monetary stability, fiscal stability, and also external stability. That is important, and also financial stability. So, when going forward, for us to move into a higher growth path, we should not weaken the foundation for stability. He warned that the reform trajectory must not be derailed by the disaster response. We should not forget that we need to focus on this area, he said. All these short-term shocks we can absorb. I am sure the fiscal space is there. We can manage that. I am not too concerned about that. Dr. Weerasinghe said the Central Bank expects supply chain disruptions from the cyclone to cause only a brief increase in inflation. We might see a small uptick in inflation as a result of these supply chain disruptions, he said. I think this is something we do not have to worry about.

Speaking at a panel discussion at the \u2018Investment Pulse \u2013 Why Sri Lanka: Investor View\u2019 session of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, he said they, however, remain on track for next year\u2019s target of $ 20 billion. Over the past 10 months, total exports in both merchandise and services exports amounted to $ 14.4 billion, reflecting a 6% growth rate, which the EDB Chief described as a significant uptick compared with the past decade and signalling a positive trend despite structural vulnerabilities. He noted that the EDB has set out an ambitious agenda to reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s longstanding dependence on traditional commodities and apparel, aiming to raise the export sector\u2019s share of GDP from roughly 19% to 25% by 2030. \u201cTo reach the $ 36 billion target, comprising $ 28 billion from merchandise and over $ 8 billion from services, Sri Lanka must sustain annual export growth of 10-12% from 2026 onwards,\u201d he said. Wijesinghe accepted the challenge of moving beyond Sri Lanka\u2019s traditional sectors, stressing that product and value-chain diversification must be paired with market diversification and structural reform. He said the Government\u2019s strategy, embodied in a soon-to-be-published National Export Development Plan (NEDP) for 2026\u20132030, aims for total export receipts of about $ 36 billion by the end of the four years, driven by faster growth in both merchandise and services exports. \u201cThe finalised NEDP will be presented in January 2026 and will provide the roadmap for translating targets into investment, skills development, and new-market penetration. If implemented, the combination of tariff reform, digital trade facilitation, renewed trade diplomacy, and focused sector development could substantially de-risk the economy and put exports on a higher-growth trajectory,\u201d he explained. According to him, the plan, which the EDB has prepared in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and after months of stakeholder consultations, rests on three pillars; boosting trade competitiveness, expanding regional and global market linkages, and promoting sustainable, trade-led growth. To change the composition of the export basket, he said the EDB has identified priority sectors beyond apparel, coconut, rubber, and tea, which together still comprise an estimated 60% of current export value. He identified several \u201ctier one\u201d sectors earmarked for rapid expansion, including ICT/BPM, which is expected to surpass $ 1.7 billion this year and grow to over $ 5 billion by 2030, as well as logistics, electronics and electrical manufacturing, food and beverages, spices, and gems and jewellery. \u201cLogistics alone, currently generating around $ 1.7 billion, is projected to grow by 15-20% annually given Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic geographic position. In addition, we have identified mineral-based exports as a high-potential tier-two sector that remains significantly underutilised,\u201d he added. He said market diversification will also be key to the strategy. \u201cThe US still remains the single largest market, accounting for nearly 25% of Sri Lanka\u2019s export earnings, and Europe contributes about 22%. The EDB is pushing for deeper penetration into African, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets. Exports to these regions have grown by over 25% during the January-October period, underscoring their potential,\u201d he pointed out. The EDB Chief also noted that economic diplomacy has been strengthened, with foreign missions now assigned export performance targets. \u201cTo capitalise on this momentum, the EDB plans to strengthen economic diplomacy and has set performance targets for Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign missions. We are also pushing a formal review of existing free trade agreements (FTAs) and preferential trade arrangements (PTAs) and are proposing negotiations on new FTAs and PTAs to support the $ 36 billion objective,\u201d he said. He noted that a Ministerial Committee, chaired by Trade, Commerce and Food Security Ministry Secretary K.A. Vimalenthirarajah, has been constituted to evaluate current agreements and will report early next year. Wijesinghe highlighted significant policy reforms included in the 2026 Budget, particularly efforts to modernise the country\u2019s outdated tariff structure to create a transparent and investor-friendly environment. \u201cThe long-discussed National Single Window has finally secured Rs. 2.5 billion in funding to move forward, enabling full online integration of key agencies including the Board of Investment (BOI), EDB, Customs, and the Land Ministry to streamline trade processes and shift to e-invoicing,\u201d he said. The EDB Chief also stated the reactivation of the Export Development Council of Ministers (EDCM), chaired by the President and revived after nearly 20 years, as a significant governance step. \u201cThe EDCM will play a key role in policy coordination, especially in light of the reconstruction needs following recent disasters. The Council, exporter forums, and sectoral task forces will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NEDP and ensuring that reforms remain aligned with national priorities,\u201d he added. He said the new strategy reflects a decisive shift in Sri Lanka\u2019s export ambitions, balancing diversification, market expansion, and policy modernisation to reduce economic risk and accelerate growth. \u201cThe goal is not only to boost revenue, but to transform the export sector into a more resilient and technologically advanced engine of the economy,\u201d Wijesinghe pointed out.

This financing builds on earlier initiatives to establish a more stable and financially sustainable power sector. This second subprogram of ADB\u2019s Power Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program will accelerate the unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) into independent successor companies for generation, transmission, system operation, and distribution, as mandated by the Electricity Act of 2024 and its 2025 amendment. The phased approach ensures a structured transition, ensuring progress in reform actions and prioritising financial sustainability. ADB Sri Lanka Country Director Takafumi Kadono said: \u201cSri Lanka has made important progress in stabilising its economy and strengthening its fiscal position. A well-functioning power sector is vital for the country\u2019s continued recovery and sustainable growth. ADB is committed to supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s long-term development and advancing key reforms in the power sector. This initiative will enhance power sector governance, foster private sector participation, and accelerate renewable energy development to drive sustainable recovery, resilience, and inclusive growth.\u201d To improve financial sustainability, the program will help implement cost-reflective tariffs and a comprehensive debt restructuring plan for the CEB. It will support the new independent successor companies in transparent allocation of existing debts. This will continue to strengthen their financial viability, enhance creditworthiness, and enable these companies to operate on a more sustainable footing. The program also aims to strengthen renewable energy development and private sector participation by enhancing transparency and supporting power sector entities that are financially sustainable. It will enable competitive procurement for large-scale renewable energy projects and identified priority generation schemes, while upholding strong environmental standards. Promoting gender equality and social inclusion is integral to the program. Energy sector agencies have implemented annual women\u2019s leadership programs, adopted inclusive policies, and launched feedback mechanisms to ensure equitable participation of female consumers and entrepreneurs. The program includes targeted support for vulnerable groups, such as maintaining lifeline tariffs and implementing measures to soften the impact of tariff adjustments and sector reforms. ADB will provide an additional $ 2.5 million technical assistance grant from its Technical Assistance Special Fund to support program implementation, build the capacity of successor companies, and help develop their business plans and power system development plans. ADB is a leading multilateral development bank supporting inclusive, resilient, and sustainable growth across Asia and the Pacific. Working with its members and partners to solve complex challenges together, ADB harnesses innovative financial tools and strategic partnerships to transform lives, build quality infrastructure, and safeguard our planet. Founded in 1966, ADB is owned by 69 members\u201450 from the region.

Speaking after returning from inspections in Badulla and other affected districts, Prof. Ranasinghe said Cyclone Ditwah, the strongest storm to impact Sri Lanka in nearly two decades, caused serious flooding, power outages, and disruptions to telecommunications and water supply in several regions. However, he asserted that recovery efforts had been swift. According to him, all major Class A and B roads in the affected areas, including routes linking Colombo\u2013Nuwara Eliya, Badulla\u2013Mahiyanganaya and other upcountry networks, have now been cleared. Only a few minor internal roads remain partially obstructed. He highlighted the rapid response of local authorities, noting that the Mahiyanganaya Hospital, which had been submerged for 60 hours, resumed normal operations within three days. \u201cThese are remarkable examples of how quickly the country has recovered,\u201d he said. Prof. Ranasinghe clarified that the declaration of a state of emergency earlier in the week had been misunderstood internationally. \u201cThis was not because the situation was worsening. It was to accelerate the mobilisation of local and international resources. Funding was released, but reaching the most affected people was slow. The emergency declaration ensured fast, efficient delivery,\u201d he explained. He said the daily disaster-management meetings at district level continue to coordinate relief and track needs on the ground. The Deputy Minister confirmed that tourist arrivals have continued steadily and no visitor had been harmed during the cyclone. \u201cNot a single foreign visitor was affected,\u201d he affirmed, adding that only about 60 assistance requests had been logged through the 1912 tourism emergency hotline, all of which have either been resolved or verified with foreign missions. He said major tourist regions including the Cultural Triangle, Yala, Ella, the Southern Coast and Nuwara Eliya are operating normally. Wildlife parks and cultural sites have reopened, and transport links have stabilised. A cruise ship with over 2,000 passengers also docked with them engaged in excursions right after few days of the cyclone. \u201cThe airport is fully operational. Tourist sites are open. Visitors are safe and moving around freely,\u201d the Deputy Minister assured. Although tourism rebounds, Prof. Ranasinghe noted that the Government\u2019s priority now is restoration of essential public services. In Badulla alone, 26 schools suffered damage, and authorities aim to reopen them within the next two to three weeks. He urged the media and industry stakeholders to convey accurate, positive updates to international audiences. \u201cThe country is back to normal, and tourism must continue because it is a major economic pillar. Except for a few interior roads, the entire network is open. Sri Lanka is ready to welcome visitors,\u201d he said. Industry stakeholders present at the briefing also shared their on-ground observations to further reassure the global tourism community.

Speaking during a panel discussion last week at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Herath clarified that the project stems from a tender initiated several years ago, prior to the current administration. He said since assuming office, the Government has engaged in multiple negotiation rounds to align Sinopec\u2019s proposal with the original tender conditions. In January 2025, Chinese State-owned oil and gas giant China Petrochemical Corporation, commonly known as Sinopec, entered into an agreement with the Sri Lankan Government to expedite the construction of a state-of-the-art $ 3.7 billion oil refinery in the investment zone near Hambantota International Port (HIP). The agreement includes provisions to fast-track unresolved issues related to water access, land allocation, and taxes, marking the largest single foreign direct investment (FDI) in Sri Lanka\u2019s history. Herath noted that while Sinopec had sought greater access to the domestic market citing shifts in global market dynamics since the original bid was submitted, the Government has maintained a firm position that it cannot deviate from the terms of the tender, which was strictly for an export-oriented facility. \u201cNegotiations have been completed. The final offer has gone to Sinopec. We believe we will have feedback and hopefully a confirmation within a matter of days,\u201d he said. Once Sinopec conveys its official position, the agreement will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval. Herath underscored that both the Government and Sinopec remain committed to finalising the deal. Calling it a \u201csignificant investment for the country,\u201d he said the project has the potential to be one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest export-oriented ventures and stressed that its successful conclusion would mark a major milestone for the new administration\u2019s investment push. \u201cWe expect this to happen before the end of the year,\u201d Herath added, reaffirming confidence that the long-delayed project is now nearing closure.

The agreement includes provisions to fast-track unresolved issues related to water access, land allocation, and taxes, marking the largest single foreign direct investment FDI in Sri Lankas history. Herath noted that while Sinopec had sought greater access to the domestic market citing shifts in global market dynamics since the original bid was submitted, the Government has maintained a firm position that it cannot deviate from the terms of the tender, which was strictly for an export-oriented facility. Negotiations have been completed. The final offer has gone to Sinopec. We believe we will have feedback and hopefully a confirmation within a matter of days, he said. Once Sinopec conveys its official position, the agreement will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval. Herath underscored that both the Government and Sinopec remain committed to finalising the deal. Calling it a significant investment for the country, he said the project has the potential to be one of Sri Lankas largest export-oriented ventures and stressed that its successful conclusion would mark a major milestone for the new administrations investment push. We expect this to happen before the end of the year, Herath added, reaffirming confidence that the long-delayed project is now nearing closure.

In steering a bold new course for leadership, one prioritising psychological strength, authentic purpose, and human connection as the foundation for enduring success, JXG pioneered a proactive blueprint for corporate stability. The JXG Holistic Leadership Summit 2025 which unfolded recently was designed to future-proof the business, creating a replicable model for how companies can retain top talent and drive sustainable growth in uncertain times. The unconventional leadership event was a curated journey of introspection, dialogue, and renewal, helping leaders align personal well-being with professional impact. The inspiring convergence united senior leaders from the Group with two internationally acclaimed facilitators; Nick Jonsson, a renowned speaker and author, widely recognised for his advocacy of mental health in executive leadership, and complementing his insights was Dona Amelia, a Southeast Asian entrepreneur and empowerment coach celebrated for her transformative journey and leadership impact. In the summit, participants explored five core dimensions of holistic leadership: surrender, purpose, connection, goals, and discipline.

A highlight of the summit was the inspiring panel discussion titled \u2018The Future of Leadership is Holistic \u2013 Are We Ready?\u2019 featuring JXG\u2019s own senior leaders. Their candid insights offered a window into how holistic practices are being integrated throughout the Group, from talent development and performance management to culture-building and strategic decision-making. The conversation strengthened JXG\u2019s vision of leadership being a shared culture of trust, growth, and collective energy. Throughout the summit, one message resonated clearly: when leaders nurture their emotional, mental, physical, social, and psychological well-being, they create ripple effects which can strengthen teams, build innovation, and drive long-term organisational success. Leadership then becomes more than achieving results, but about building healthier, more connected, and future-ready organisations.

Q: How would you characterise JKH\u2019s Q2 performance against the broader economic backdrop? Niroshan: The macro environment has clearly stabilised, with inflation around 5%, a steadier currency and interest rates in the high single digits. Tourism has exceeded 1.97 million arrivals, growing double digits, and remittances remain strong. This has supported consumption, with Supermarkets and Consumer Foods seeing low to mid-teens growth in volumes and same store sales. In this environment, JKH reported an 88% rise in revenue to Rs. 144.8 billion in Q2. The New Energy Vehicle business (JKCG/BYD) handed over about 3,700 units and has more than 3,800 orders in the pipeline. EBITDA more than doubled to Rs. 18.4 billion, with PBT up 243% and PAT up 176%. Leisure moved from a loss to an EBITDA profit, and City of Dreams Sri Lanka, though still in its launch phase, was already close to EBITDA breakeven. The Group\u2019s broader confidence in its strategy and cash generation ability was also reflected in the doubling of its first interim dividend to Rs. 0.10 per share; a Rs. 1.8-billion payout. Sachintha: Performance was broadly in line with expectations, but particularly strong where structural tailwinds exist. Retail remained a standout, led by BYD, though the customs dispute and broader policy headwinds around EV imports remain near term challenges. Nations Trust Bank delivered another strong quarter as well, supporting Financial Services. Transportation posted solid volume growth but margins were affected by an unfavourable cargo mix, even as CWIT scaled faster than expected and SAGT benefitted from higher throughput at the Port of Colombo. City of Dreams Sri Lanka was almost at EBITDA breakeven. Despite finance costs from newly operational components, gearing remains comfortable and the core businesses continue to generate strong cash flows. Q: What are the key indicators that demonstrate the Group\u2019s underlying resilience? Niroshan: The clearest indicator is the step up in earnings. First half EBITDA reached Rs. 31.3 billion, up 98%, and the Group is on track to exceed last year\u2019s Rs. 45.7 billion. Even excluding CODSL and JKCG, Q2 PBT rose to about Rs. 4.3 billion from Rs. 1.6 billion, showing how broad based the improvement is. Operating cash flow over the last twelve months is around Rs. 41.3 billion, with Rs. 2.9 billion generated this quarter alone, supporting commitments as the Group moves from investment to harvest mode. ROCE has improved to roughly 3.5% on a last 12 months basis; still below pre crisis levels but clearly trending up. Sachintha: A major factor is that JKH has now completed its heavy capex cycle and moved into a phase focused on generating returns. Recurring EBITDA has strengthened, making cash flows more predictable. With rising earnings, improving cash generation and a stable near term capex outlook, the Group is well placed to meet upcoming obligations comfortably. Q: How comfortable are you with JKH\u2019s balance sheet, gearing and management of financial risk? Sachintha: As at 30 September 2025, gearing was around 32%, or closer to 30% excluding JKCG\u2019s trade facilities, which is very manageable for a conglomerate of this scale. The debt maturity profile is weighted toward FY26 and FY27, but the Group has ample refinancing flexibility. Currency and interest rate exposure are managed through a mix of Rupee and US dollar balances and by aligning borrowings with the broader debt profile. Strong foreign currency contributions from Leisure and Transportation add liquidity and help absorb movements in both the Rupee and global interest rates. Meanwhile, the borrowing book is actively balanced across fixed, variable and hedged positions. Niroshan: Net debt to EBITDA is about 3.5 times, a marked improvement from 8.4 times in FY2020/21. The Group\u2019s liquidity is solid, supported by operating cash flows, and it has moved beyond the capital-intensive phase of projects like CODSL. Furthermore, noncurrent borrowings exceed current obligations, reducing near term refinancing risk, and a refinancing planned for next year should extend maturities and improve the overall cost of debt. Thus, for a diversified group of its size, the financial positioning is healthy and manageable. Q: JKH has gone through a heavy capex phase. How do you view the investment strategy and return profile of assets like City of Dreams and West Container Terminal? Niroshan: City of Dreams Sri Lanka is a landmark $ 1.2 billion investment. The Nuwa Sri Lanka hotel, the first phase of The Shoppes mall and the luxury casino all opened in August 2025, and the project is now fully operational with no further outflows. The resort\u2019s EBITDA loss narrowed to Rs. 64 million in Q2, versus about Rs. 1.2 billion a year earlier, supported by rising occupancies, casino footfall and MICE bookings. The West Container Terminal is also progressing well; Phase 2 is underway and full completion is targeted for end 2026. WCT 1 is expected to be close to PAT breakeven this financial year, ahead of the typical first full year trajectory for a project of this scale. Sachintha: JKH is now moving past its most capex-intensive phase, with major projects like City of Dreams Sri Lanka and the West Container Terminal entering their operational ramps. COD is still early in its lifecycle, but the initial traction shows that the asset has the potential to scale meaningfully as tourism and MICE-related activity improve.

Additionally, CH17 has developed a program that could assist agencies who are in control over any type of aid relief work, to monitor on real time basis, the process and to take immediate action should there be shortcomings. CH17 has launched a special nationwide initiative to honour and support everyone working tirelessly on disaster relief efforts. The program will recognise first responders, donors, volunteers, welfare teams and media personnel who have stepped forward selflessly to help rebuild the country after the cyclone devastation. CH17 CEO Jumar Preena said, \u201cWe believe our country will rise again, but only if we take the time to recognise those who served first and served hardest. We will open this Privilege Program to all those risking their safety, time, and comfort to support the destitute. Their service is the foundation on which Sri Lanka will rebuild.\u201d As part of this initiative, CH17 will issue a simple digital privilege card to registered responders. This electronic card will carry the volunteer\u2019s name and a unique registration number. It will also include a scannable QR code and a 16-digit card number \u2014 just like a payment card number but used only for identity and fairness. When shown at participating stores, it will unlock special discounts funded entirely by merchants who wish to support caregivers. CH17 partner retailers from closed-group Privilege Networks, have been requested to accept the digital card and extend special discounts to responders during purchases. CH17 will also invite thousands more private merchants, shops and service providers to join this goodwill effort, so more volunteers can be supported in more places across the island. The entire initiative will be offered as CH17\u2019s contribution toward the national rebuilding mission led by the Rebuilding Sri Lanka Task Force. CH17 is prepared to launch the program immediately and begin issuing the first 10,000 cards under the theme Rebuild Sri Lanka.

Additionally, CH17 has developed a program that could assist agencies who are in control over any type of aid relief work, to monitor on real time basis, the process and to take immediate action should there be shortcomings. CH17 has launched a special nationwide initiative to honour and support everyone working tirelessly on disaster relief efforts. The program will recognise first responders, donors, volunteers, welfare teams and media personnel who have stepped forward selflessly to help rebuild the country after the cyclone devastation. CH17 CEO Jumar Preena said, We believe our country will rise again, but only if we take the time to recognise those who served first and served hardest. We will open this Privilege Program to all those risking their safety, time, and comfort to support the destitute. Their service is the foundation on which Sri Lanka will rebuild. As part of this initiative, CH17 will issue a simple digital privilege card to registered responders. This electronic card will carry the volunteers name and a unique registration number. It will also include a scannable QR code and a 16-digit card number  just like a payment card number but used only for identity and fairness. When shown at participating stores, it will unlock special discounts funded entirely by merchants who wish to support caregivers. CH17 partner retailers from closed-group Privilege Networks, have been requested to accept the digital card and extend special discounts to responders during purchases. CH17 will also invite thousands more private merchants, shops and service providers to join this goodwill effort, so more volunteers can be supported in more places across the island. The entire initiative will be offered as CH17s contribution toward the national rebuilding mission led by the Rebuilding Sri Lanka Task Force. CH17 is prepared to launch the program immediately and begin issuing the first 10,000 cards under the theme Rebuild Sri Lanka. This is the first large-scale volunteer recognition and privilege support card introduced by an independent Sri Lankan organisation for disaster recovery efforts. CH17 has previously deployed a similar humanitarian recognition system during the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2021.

This is an important step towards building a sustainable, gender-responsive entrepreneurial ecosystem in the Northern Province. The program, formally known as Growth, Resilience, Investment, and Training (GRIT), is a six-year joint project (2022\u20132027) between Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and the World University Service of Canada (WUSC) implemented by Hatch and other local ecosystem partners, that focuses on promoting resilience, innovation, and economic empowerment among female entrepreneurs. The founders showcased the potential and impact of female-led enterprises addressing important market gaps in Northern Sri Lanka. By enhancing business skills, visibility, market access, and potential investment opportunities, Hatch maintains its commitment to making entrepreneurship accessible, inclusive, and scalable for women in emerging regions through this platform. Hatch Innovation CEO Mevan Peiris said, \u201cBy supporting talented and determined female entrepreneurs who are innovating within real community needs, the GRIT project aims to create opportunity where it matters most. Our goal is to boost these entrepreneurs\u2019 confidence, capability, and connectivity so they can thrive sustainably and help the long-term economic growth of the Northern region\u2014which has historically been underserved. Hatch is committed to assisting high-potential entrepreneurs and allowing more women to take the lead in Sri Lanka\u2019s innovation landscape.\u201d Senior Program Manager Ruvanara Tillekeratne added, \u201cThe success of this first cohort demonstrates what can transpire when women are provided the proper resources, networks, and mentors. GRIT is encouraging long-term resilience and regional economic development, not just businesses.\u201d The program\u2019s priority on developing practical skills, one-on-one mentorship, investment readiness, and strategic growth planning is shown in the GRIT cohort, which represents a range of sectors. Vonderly Founder Kirushanthi Shobethan shared her experience: \u201cThe program began with a thorough assessment of our company\u2019s specific needs and realistic objectives. Subsequently, industry experts offered bespoke resources and practical guidance in crucial areas, including finance, HR, sales, and branding. The one-on-one mentoring, combined with real-world business examples, provided genuinely practical insights that significantly enhanced the experience. We extend our sincere gratitude to all our partners for their support throughout this transformative journey. With a common goal of strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem, the event brought together professionals from the development sector, investors, corporate CSR leaders, angel networks, incubators and accelerators, government stakeholders, and media partners. By demonstrating that women-led startups can reach scaled success with the correct support, the Demo Day event will encourage aspiring female entrepreneurs in the Northern Province to participate in subsequent program cohorts.

The Bank said this ground-breaking initiative, a first of its kind at this scale in Sri Lanka\u2019s banking sector, was designed to empower staff across the branch network and head office departments to embrace a mindset of driving digital innovation and enhancing customer experience. By encouraging teams to develop practical and scalable solutions that address real customer interactions, the programme not only sought to generate ideas, but to deliver tangible outcomes that strengthen Commercial Bank\u2019s strategic pillars of digitalisation and customer excellence. \u201cOur people are our greatest asset, and this Challenge has proven that when their creativity and passion are channelled towards innovation, the results are extraordinary,\u201d said Mr Sanath Manatunge, Managing Director/CEO at Commercial Bank. \u201cThe Innovation Challenge is more than a competition \u2013 it is a catalyst for change that enables us to deliver better, faster, and more seamless experiences to our customers while preparing the Bank for the future. As a Bank with digitalisation at the core of its strategy, we are proud to see our staff designing solutions that can be implemented and scaled across the organisation. The winning proposals are working innovations that will directly enhance customer journeys and strengthen our position as a digital leader in the industry.\u201d Commenting on the outcome of the initiative, Mr Sumudu Gunawardhana, Chief Information Officer of Commercial Bank said: \u201cIn today\u2019s financial landscape, the best ideas come from those closest to our customers, which is why our innovation strategy focuses on empowering frontline staff, branch teams and relationship managers who understand client needs first-hand. The Innovation Challenge brings that vision to life by providing the tools, mentorship and platform for grassroots ideas to grow, and it was inspiring to see colleagues use AI and data analytics to create practical solutions while breaking silos to solve real customer challenges. This initiative proves that with the right support, our people will shape the bank\u2019s future, building a sustainable engine for innovation that keeps us agile, customer-centric and ahead in delivering exceptional banking experiences.\u201d The Challenge ran as a four-month innovation sprint and drew an enthusiastic response, with 112 teams comprising more than 600 staff members from branches and departments across the country. Each team consisted of three to ten members, and participants were required to register, submit detailed outlines of their proposed solutions, and refine these into prototypes for evaluation by a panel of judges. From this wide pool, 12 teams were shortlisted and mentored by eight members of the corporate management to progress to the final stage, where their prototypes were presented before the judges. The competition culminated at the Bank\u2019s Excellence Awards ceremony, where three winning teams were recognised with Gold, Silver, and Bronze Passes and attractive cash prizes. The Gold Award was won by Team Pelawatte from the Pelawatte Branch, and their solution was immediately implemented by the bank. The Silver Award went to Team Q-bits from IS Audit, while the Bronze Award was secured by Team Spark Minds from the Wattala Branch. The Bank confirmed that the winning entries, along with other shortlisted projects, will be developed and implemented. The Bank emphasised that the Innovation Challenge was not merely a competition but an investment in cultivating a culture of innovation among its staff. By empowering employees at all levels to collaborate and experiment with new ideas, Commercial Bank said it had successfully channelled creativity into practical solutions that would directly improve customer experiences, internal processes, and overall service quality.

The unveiling signals the completion of Unity Plaza\u2019s ambitious redevelopment journey that began with its relaunch in November 2023.

Behind the wheel of each tuk-tuk is a dedicated driver\u2014someone who works tirelessly to support their family, often under challenging financial circumstances. As the nation continues to navigate economic difficulties, these drivers are under increasing pressure. Yet, their resilience and commitment remain unwavering. Beyond their role in transportation, three-wheeler drivers often serve as first responders in emergencies\u2014rushing the injured to hospitals, helping stranded motorists, or offering rides late at night when no other options are available. Their contribution to society is significant, though frequently overlooked. In recognition of these everyday heroes, Orient Finance PLC has launched a heartfelt campaign that brings to life the real story of a three-wheeler driver. The campaign follows a day in his life, shedding light on the hard work, perseverance, and sense of responsibility that defines their profession. It aims to raise awareness of the struggles they endure while celebrating the vital role they play within their communities. This initiative is more than just a commercial\u2014it is a tribute to the three-wheeler community. Through this campaign, Orient Finance reaffirms its commitment to supporting these drivers, not only through words but with meaningful financial solutions designed specifically for their needs. Speaking about the campaign, K.M.M. Jabir, Executive Director and CEO of Orient Finance PLC, said, \u201cThese individuals are the backbone of our local transport network. They operate under trying conditions to deliver an essential service that many rely on\u2014whether for commuting, emergencies, or day-to-day mobility. At Orient Finance, we deeply value their contribution. Our role extends beyond financial services; we are here to uplift their lives. The First Month\u2019s Rental Waiver is just one of many steps we are taking to offer real, impactful support.\u201d At the heart of this initiative is the Orient Tuk Leasing plan, carefully crafted to meet the unique financial challenges faced by three-wheeler drivers. The plan offers a one-month grace period before the first rental payment, providing much-needed breathing space to manage household expenses, vehicle repairs, and maintenance. With low monthly installments and the option to borrow a higher amount, it helps ease the strain of ongoing costs. In addition, the approval process is quick and straightforward, ensuring drivers receive timely support without unnecessary delays. The plan also includes a Life Insurance Scheme, which provides Rs. 500,000 in support to a driver\u2019s family in the event of an untimely death. Already, more than ten families have benefitted from this safety net, reflecting the tangible impact of the initiative. For those seeking Sharia-compliant financial solutions, Orient Finance also offers Ijarah Tuk Leasing, reinforcing its commitment to inclusive and accessible services for all communities. Recognising that many drivers invest their life savings into down payments\u2014often leaving little to cover immediate needs\u2014Orient Finance\u2019s approach provides both short-term relief and long-term financial stability. The company\u2019s goal is to empower drivers to focus on what truly matters: their livelihoods, their loved ones, and their future. With this campaign and the enhanced leasing offering, Orient Finance PLC continues to stand with Sri Lanka\u2019s three-wheeler drivers\u2014not just as a financial institution, but as a true partner that listens, understands, and acts.

As the nation continues to navigate economic difficulties, these drivers are under increasing pressure. Yet, their resilience and commitment remain unwavering. Beyond their role in transportation, three-wheeler drivers often serve as first responders in emergenciesrushing the injured to hospitals, helping stranded motorists, or offering rides late at night when no other options are available. Their contribution to society is significant, though frequently overlooked. In recognition of these everyday heroes, Orient Finance PLC has launched a heartfelt campaign that brings to life the real story of a three-wheeler driver. The campaign follows a day in his life, shedding light on the hard work, perseverance, and sense of responsibility that defines their profession. It aims to raise awareness of the struggles they endure while celebrating the vital role they play within their communities. This initiative is more than just a commercialit is a tribute to the three-wheeler community. Through this campaign, Orient Finance reaffirms its commitment to supporting these drivers, not only through words but with meaningful financial solutions designed specifically for their needs. Speaking about the campaign, K.M.M. Jabir, Executive Director and CEO of Orient Finance PLC, said, These individuals are the backbone of our local transport network. They operate under trying conditions to deliver an essential service that many rely onwhether for commuting, emergencies, or day-to-day mobility. At Orient Finance, we deeply value their contribution. Our role extends beyond financial services we are here to uplift their lives. The First Months Rental Waiver is just one of many steps we are taking to offer real, impactful support. At the heart of this initiative is the Orient Tuk Leasing plan, carefully crafted to meet the unique financial challenges faced by three-wheeler drivers. The plan offers a one-month grace period before the first rental payment, providing much-needed breathing space to manage household expenses, vehicle repairs, and maintenance. With low monthly installments and the option to borrow a higher amount, it helps ease the strain of ongoing costs. In addition, the approval process is quick and straightforward, ensuring drivers receive timely support without unnecessary delays. The plan also includes a Life Insurance Scheme, which provides Rs. 500,000 in support to a drivers family in the event of an untimely death. Already, more than ten families have benefitted from this safety net, reflecting the tangible impact of the initiative. For those seeking Sharia-compliant financial solutions, Orient Finance also offers Ijarah Tuk Leasing, reinforcing its commitment to inclusive and accessible services for all communities. Recognising that many drivers invest their life savings into down paymentsoften leaving little to cover immediate needsOrient Finances approach provides both short-term relief and long-term financial stability. The companys goal is to empower drivers to focus on what truly matters their livelihoods, their loved ones, and their future. With this campaign and the enhanced leasing offering, Orient Finance PLC continues to stand with Sri Lankas three-wheeler driversnot just as a financial institution, but as a true partner that listens, understands, and acts.

The plan is focused on a broad-based product offensive, increased electrification, new approaches to engineering and manufacturing, the adoption of new technologies, and the use of strategic partnerships to increase global unit sales and improve profitability. The plan is positioned as a bridge between the Nissan NEXT business transformation plan running from fiscal* 2020 through fiscal 2023 and Nissan Ambition 2030, the company\u2019s long-term vision. The new plan is split into mid- term imperatives for fiscal years 2024 through 2026, and mid-long-term actions to be carried out through 2030. Nissan President and Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida said: \u201cThe Arc plan shows our path to the future. It illustrates our continuous progression and ability to navigate changing market conditions. This plan will enable us to go further and faster in driving value and competitiveness. Faced with extreme market volatility, Nissan is taking decisive actions guided by the new plan to ensure sustainable growth and profitability.\u201d Under the two-part plan, Nissan will first take actions to ensure volume growth through a tailored regional strategy and prepare for an accelerated transition to EVs, supported by a balanced electrified/ICE product portfolio, volume growth in major markets and financial discipline. Through these initiatives Nissan aims to lift annual sales by 1 million units and increase its operating profit margin to more than 6%, both by the end of fiscal year 2026. This will pave the way for the second part of the plan aimed to enable the EV transition and realize long- term profitable growth, supported by smart partnerships, enhanced EV competitiveness, differentiated innovations and new revenue streams. By fiscal year 2030, Nissan sees a revenue potential of 2.5 trillion yen from new business opportunities. Nissan plans to launch 30 new models over the next three years, of which 16 will be electrified, and 14 will be ICE models, to meet the diversified customer needs in markets where the pace of electrification differs. Nissan plans to launch a total of 34 electrified models from fiscal year 2024 and 2030 to cover all segments, with the model mix of electrified vehicles expected to account for 40% globally by fiscal year 2026 and rise to 60% by the end of the decade. In key regions and markets, Nissan\u2019s actions by fiscal year 2026 (unless otherwise indicated) include: The product offensive will be supported by new development and manufacturing approaches aimed to make EVs more affordable and increase profitability. By developing EVs in families, integrating powertrains, utilizing next-generation modular manufacturing, group sourcing, and battery innovations, Nissan aims to reduce the cost of next-generation EVs by 30% (when compared to the current model Ariya crossover) and achieve cost-parity between EVs and ICE models by fiscal year 2030. In the area of family development alone, the cost of subsequent vehicles \u2013 those developed based on the main vehicle in the family \u2013 can be reduced by 50%, the variation of trim parts reduced by 70% and development lead time shortened by four months. By adopting modular manufacturing, the vehicle production line will be shortened, reducing the production time per vehicle by 20%. Under the Arc plan, more plants in Japan and overseas will adopt the Nissan Intelligent Factory concept, with the Oppama and Nissan Motor Kyushu plants in Japan, the Sunderland Plant in the UK and Canton and Smyrna plants in the U.S. starting the adoption from fiscal year 2026 through 2030. Meanwhile the EV36Zero production approach will be extended from Sunderland in the UK to plants including Canton, Decherd and Smyrna in the U.S., and Tochigi and Kyushu in Japan from fiscal year 2025 through 2028. The plan includes proposals to accelerate the evolution of vehicle intelligence technologies such as next-generation ProPILOT driver-assistance system, which realize door-to-door autonomous driving technology from on-highway to off- highway, private premises, and parking. Nissan will offer enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all solid-state batteries to provide diversified EVs to meet different customer needs. Nissan will significantly enhance NCM li-ion batteries, reducing quick-charging time by 50% and increasing energy density by 50% compared to the Ariya. LFP batteries, to be developed and produced in Japan, will be launched that will reduce cost by 30% compared to the Sakura EV minivehicle. New EVs with enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all-solid-state batteries will be launched in fiscal year 2028. Nissan will harness strategic partnerships to stay competitive and offer a global portfolio of products and technology. Nissan will continue to leverage the alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors in Europe, LATAM, ASEAN and India. In China, Nissan will fully utilize its local assets to meet the needs of China and beyond; and explore new partnerships in Japan and the U.S. Batteries will be developed and sourced with partners to bring 135 gigawatt hours of global capacity. Underpinning the plan is firm financial discipline, enabling stable CAPEX and R&D investment ratio versus net revenue of between 7% to 8% excluding battery capacity investment. Additionally, Nissan plans to invest more than 400 billion yen in battery capacity. Meanwhile, investment in electrification will increase progressively, becoming more than 70% by fiscal year 2026. Managing these investments is aimed to allow delivering benefits to all stakeholders, with Nissan maintaining positive free cash flow before M&A \u2013 even after electrification investments. This is to secure total shareholder return at more than 30%. Nissan aims to maintain net cash at a healthy level of 1 trillion yen throughout the Arc plan period. \u201cUnder this comprehensive plan we will enhance Nissan\u2019s competitiveness and achieve sustainable profitability,\u201d added Uchida. \u201cNissan is confident that it has what it takes to properly execute this plan, which will provide us with the firm foundation we need to bridge to our Nissan Ambition 2030 vision.\u201d", "content_hash": "f7bc2e298d06e2c92a93c26a19f2a1b1", "scraped_at": "2025-12-08T22:56:44.245687", "updated_at": "2025-12-08T22:56:44.245698", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Nissan to strengthen product portfolio, advance electrification, introduce new ways of developing and manufacturing, and harness partnerships to achieve Ambition 2030 vision YOKOHAMA, Japan Nissan Motor Co., Ltd, today launched The Arc, its new business plan to drive value and strengthen competitiveness.

The Bank\u2019s Development Credit Department, together with its Kaduruwela Branch, recently hosted the inaugural awareness programme titled \u201cEnhancing Paddy Productivity and Farmer Livelihoods through Adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and High-Tech Agriculture in the Polonnaruwa District.\u201d Held at the Agbo Hotel, Giritale, the event brought together more than 120 farmers from eight divisional areas, representing the district\u2019s diverse agricultural communities. This initiative is part of Commercial Bank\u2019s broader vision to drive national food security , empower the rural economy , and support farmers through knowledge-sharing and sustainable agricultural solutions that foster long-term economic resilience. This initiative was designed to address the persistent productivity gap in local paddy cultivation. While Polonnaruwa\u2019s average yield currently stands at around 4.5 metric tonnes per hectare, agricultural experts estimate the potential yield at approximately six metric tonnes. To help bridge this gap, the programme focused on creating awareness about modern cultivation methods, responsible use of agro-chemicals, mechanisation, financial management, and environmental sustainability. Among those who addressed the gathering were representatives of the Bank, the Department of Agriculture, the Eastern University, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka \u2013 North Central Region, A. Baur & Co. and Browns Agriculture. The sessions covered key topics such as the adoption of GAP principles, high-tech agricultural techniques, sustainable use of agro-inputs, and new technologies in paddy machinery. The Bank said the initiative aims to position Polonnaruwa as a model district for sustainable, GAP-based paddy cultivation. It also seeks to promote financial inclusion among rural communities by connecting farmers with formal banking channels and customised financial solutions to fund mechanisation, crop diversification, and value-added processing. Speaking about the programme, Mrs Mithila Shamini, Assistant General Manager \u2013 Personal Banking/SME at Commercial Bank said: \u201cAgriculture is the backbone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, and its transformation is central to our nation\u2019s food security and rural prosperity. At Commercial Bank, we believe that empowering farmers through knowledge, technology, and financial inclusion is key to unlocking this transformation. Our initiative in Polonnaruwa is about more than improving yields \u2013 it is about strengthening livelihoods, modernising rural enterprise, and ensuring the sustainability of farming for future generations.\u201d Commercial Bank\u2019s collaboration with the Faculty of Agriculture of the Eastern University, the Department of Agriculture, A. Baur & Co., and Browns Agriculture reflects a holistic approach that unites financial expertise with agronomic knowledge and technological innovation. The Bank\u2019s long-term vision is to help create \u201cAgri Modernisation Villages\u201d in partnership with academic and government institutions as hubs that demonstrate how modern, climate-smart, and economically viable agriculture can thrive in Sri Lanka. The programme also underlines the Bank\u2019s continuing efforts to promote responsible and inclusive banking. By working closely with the farming community, Commercial Bank aims to stimulate demand for agri-loans, mechanisation finance, and SME credit for rice millers, while deepening engagement and trust in the region. Through initiatives such as this, Commercial Bank said it continues to position itself as the leading private-sector bank championing national food security, agricultural modernisation, and the empowerment of Sri Lanka\u2019s rural economy. The first Sri Lankan bank with a market capitalisation exceeding US$ 1 billion, Commercial Bank was also the first bank in the country to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World, and has the highest Tier I capital base among all Sri Lankan banks. The Bank is the largest private sector lender in Sri Lanka and the largest lender to the country\u2019s SME sector. Commercial Bank is also a leader in digital innovation and is Sri Lanka\u2019s first 100% carbon-neutral bank. Commercial Bank operates a network of strategically located branches and automated machines island-wide, and has the widest international footprint among Sri Lankan banks, with 20 branches in Bangladesh, a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake in the Maldives, a microfinance company in Myanmar and a representative office in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).

This figure was 29% in Q4 2023 , and Coveware\u2019s stats show that diminishing payments have remained steady since early 2019. This decrease is due to organizations implementing more advanced protective measures, mounting legal pressure not to meet the crooks\u2019 financial demands, and cybercriminals repeatedly breaching promises not to publish or resale stolen data if a ransom is paid. However, it is essential to note that despite the drop in the payment rate, the amount paid to ransomware actors is higher than ever before, reaching $1.1 billion last year , according to a Chainalysis report. This is due to ransomware gangs hitting more organizations by escalating their attack frequency and demanding more substantial figures for not exposing stolen secrets and providing victims with a decryption key. Concerning Q1 2024, Coveware reports a 32% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) drop in the average ransom payment, now at $381,980, and a 25% QoQ increase in the median ransom payment, which stands at $250,000. This simultaneous drop in average and rise in median ransom payments indicates a decrease in high-figure payments and an increase in moderate amounts. This could be caused by ransom demands becoming more modest and/or fewer high-value targets succumbing to extortion. Regarding initial infiltration methods, there\u2019s a\u00a0rising number of cases where this is unknown, reaching nearly half of all reported cases in the first quarter of 2024.

Powell said recent inflation figures  though higher than expected  didnt materially change the overall picture, according to the text of a speech at Stanford University in California. He reiterated his expectation that it will likely be appropriate to begin lowering rates at some point this year. Treasury yields and the dollar pushed lower, boosting bullion by as much as 0.6 to a new all-time high of 2,295.25 an ounce. US gold futures, meanwhile, crossed the 2,300 mark, up 1.4 at 2,313.60 per ounce. While Powell reiterated the Feds wait-and-see approach before lowering borrowing costs, the US central banks path to cut rates is unchanged despite recent inflation figures. Thats very gold positive as it suggests that the Fed will cut significantly before the inflation target is reached, said Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, in a Bloomberg note. Investors are still expecting a first rate cut at the Feds June 11-12 policy meeting, even as the stronger recent economic data has sown investor doubts about that outcome.

The fiscal deficit is set to be wider than our current forecast of 7.1% of GDP in 2024 in light of the new data, even after excluding bank recapitalization costs, and the revenue/GDP ratio would be lower than Fitch had assumed earlier. The government is targeting a budget deficit of 9.1% of GDP in 2024, wider than a revised estimate of 8.5% in 2023. However, without bank recapitalization costs, the deficit in 2024 would be a narrower 7.6% of GDP. Excluding recapitalization costs, the budget targets a primary surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 2024, against a deficit of 0.7% in 2023. However, including recapitalization costs pushes the 2024 primary deficit target to 0.6% of GDP. The primary surplus goal for 2024, excluding bank recapitalization, is broadly in line with the 0.8% of GDP projected by the IMF in March when it approved Sri Lanka\u2019s USD3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Fitch also see the revenue target as relatively aligned. However, the government\u2019s expenditure target for 2024, at 22.2% of GDP, is somewhat higher than the 19.7% the IMF had envisioned and well above the revised budget estimate of 18.7% for 2023. The release of the next tranche of EFF financing, worth around USD330 million, will depend partly on the IMF\u2019s assessment of Sri Lanka\u2019s progress in securing financing assurances from official creditors. Fitch believes there has been some progress since March, but the timeline for a restructuring deal with official creditors remains unclear.  Fitch believes there are significant risks to the government\u2019s revenue goal for 2024. Sri Lanka has a record of fiscal slippage, and revenue collection fell 29% short of target over 9M23. The authorities aim to raise revenue by almost 45% in 2024. This will be aided by a planned 3pp increase in the value-added tax to 18%, but the boost to revenue from inflation is set to weaken in 2024. The Rating agency project consumer prices will rise by 8.7% on average in 2024, compared with 22.1% in 2023. The lift from economic growth, which Fitch projects at 3.3% in 2024, will also be modest. Downside risks to revenue could be offset by lower-than-budgeted spending.

The fiscal deficit is set to be wider than our current forecast of 7.1 of GDP in 2024 in light of the new data, even after excluding bank recapitalization costs, and the revenueGDP ratio would be lower than Fitch had assumed earlier. The government is targeting a budget deficit of 9.1 of GDP in 2024, wider than a revised estimate of 8.5 in 2023. However, without bank recapitalization costs, the deficit in 2024 would be a narrower 7.6 of GDP. Excluding recapitalization costs, the budget targets a primary surplus of 0.8 of GDP in 2024, against a deficit of 0.7 in 2023. However, including recapitalization costs pushes the 2024 primary deficit target to 0.6 of GDP. The primary surplus goal for 2024, excluding bank recapitalization, is broadly in line with the 0.8 of GDP projected by the IMF in March when it approved Sri Lankas USD3 billion Extended Fund Facility EFF. Fitch also see the revenue target as relatively aligned. However, the governments expenditure target for 2024, at 22.2 of GDP, is somewhat higher than the 19.7 the IMF had envisioned and well above the revised budget estimate of 18.7 for 2023. The release of the next tranche of EFF financing, worth around USD330 million, will depend partly on the IMFs assessment of Sri Lankas progress in securing financing assurances from official creditors. Fitch believes there has been some progress since March, but the timeline for a restructuring deal with official creditors remains unclear. Fitch believes there are significant risks to the governments revenue goal for 2024. Sri Lanka has a record of fiscal slippage, and revenue collection fell 29 short of target over 9M23. The authorities aim to raise revenue by almost 45 in 2024. This will be aided by a planned 3pp increase in the value-added tax to 18, but the boost to revenue from inflation is set to weaken in 2024. The Rating agency project consumer prices will rise by 8.7 on average in 2024, compared with 22.1 in 2023. The lift from economic growth, which Fitch projects at 3.3 in 2024, will also be modest. Downside risks to revenue could be offset by lower-than-budgeted spending.

Officials representing the Ministry of Finance pointed out that an amended Bill has already been submitted to Parliament to exempt the process from the 2.5% social security tax imposed on the importation of gems for re-export, and the relief is to be given to businessmen in the future.

In order to avoid the tax levied by the government on cash transactions of more than Rs.500,000/=, the gem businessmen in the field are often tempted to carry out such high value cash transactions in cash and as a result, the businessmen who transact money fairly through banks and pay taxes properly to the government have to leave the field.

The biggest increase was in domestic interest expense, which rose by 51.6 to 1,273 Bn in the first half of this year. The Committee members raised various questions regarding the fiscal position, Economic performance, expenditure, and the performance of the state-owned enterprises based on the statistics presented by the officials present. Key concerns raised by the member of COPF were regarding the 11.5 percent contraction in the first quarter of 2023. The Committee questioned the root causes of such contraction and the specific measures taken to address such root causes preventing further economic downturns The Committee further questioned the sustainable plan of the Ministry to achieve growth in line with the Hon. Presidents Vision 2048. Though there was a substantial discussion on the plan for growth to reach a developed country, it was disclosed that there was no coherent strategy. The Committee was of the notion that the response to the Committee queries by the officials who were present, was ineffective and in lacks clarity. The Committee also queried the increase of taxes due naturally to inflation vs policy changes in taxes. Whilst expressing the importance of being prepared with adequate data and statistics when presenting before the Committee, COPF also emphasized that the officials of the Ministry of Finance should be more responsible and have a proper vision along with a focused team to achieve the goal of a sustainable economy.", "sentiment_score": 0.098, "sentiment_label": "neutral", "entities": {"PERSON": ["Harsha de Silva"], "ORG": ["Parliament", "the Ministry of Finance", "VAT", "the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report", "Committee", "National Policies", "YoY", "MoF", "The Committee on Public Finance", "COPF"], "GPE": [], "LOC": []}, "keywords": ["this year", "various questions", "the root causes", "the member", "expenditure", "a sustainable economy", "an increase", "the goal", "consideration", "discussions", "the biggest increase", "the committee", "no coherent strategy", "40.5 yoy.", "the statistics"], "sectors": ["transport", "finance", "agriculture", "technology", "government"], "language": "en", "word_count": 414, "enriched_at": "2025-12-08T23:12:45.330041"}, "224": {"source": "EconomicTimes.lk", "section": "economy", "title": "Central Bank releases a Pamphlet on Monetary Policy Implementation in Sri Lanka", "url": "https://economictimes.lk/index.php/2023/07/17/central-bank-releases-a-pamphlet-on-monetary-policy-implementation-in-sri-lanka/", "text": "The Central Bank has released a pamphlet on \u2018Monetary Policy Implementation in Sri Lanka\u2019 in all three languages, with the aim of enhancing awareness of the general public on the role of the Central Bank in the implementation of monetary policy in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has been a country that has followed this trend repetitively, having entered into 16 economic stabilisation programmes during 1965-2020, and recently entered into its 17th economic stabilisation programme with the IMF. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) estimates in 2019 (prior to the pandemic and crisis), showed that Sri Lanka needed to spend an additional 9 per cent of GDP per year to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. While the National Budget for 2023 aims to reduce the budget deficit from 10.2 per cent of GDP in 2022 to 7.9 per cent in 2023, mainly financed through domestic sources. This could limit the resources available for climate and sustainability-related interventions, and put pressure for higher interest rates. The country faces significant climate change risks as well. The global climate risk index for 2021, ranked Sri Lanka as the 23rd most affected country from extreme weather conditions during the period of 2000\u20132019. The country is also expected to see a 1.2 per cent annual GDP loss by 2050 due to effects of climate change. Therefore, moving into a conventional IMF agreement may not reap the full benefits required for Sri Lanka. In parallel to the IMF programme and negotiations with other multilateral agencies, alternative financing mechanisms should be explored in order to achieve Sri Lanka\u2019s development goals while overcoming the debt overhang. Alternative financing mechanisms, if effectively implemented, have the potential to provide long-term credit benefits by offering debt relief while also increasing investments that could strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s resilience to environmental risks. This can be a win-win situation for the country to achieve debt sustainability as well promote economic development in the country. Alternative Financing Options The Government of Sri Lanka has currently embarked on capacity development programmes for the adoption of alternative financing mechanisms such as green bonds. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) too has developed a policy and regulatory framework governing green bonds and in April 2023, the SEC approved rules for issuing green bonds for listed companies and statutory entities. This was subsequent to the publication of the green finance taxonomy by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which provided clarity on economic activities that are environmentally sustainable. Therefore, the landscape for adopting alternative financing mechanisms is being created, enabling a favorable environment for the use of alternative financing mechanisms in the future. An array of solutions can be considered for Sri Lanka, some of which are more appropriate than others in the country context and government priorities. Debt-for-climate or debt-for-sustainability swaps have proven to be a successful debt alleviation tool globally while promoting investment in green and sustainable projects. Carbon credits too can be a feasible and innovative way to address debt overhang and climate change simultaneously but requires more research on the impacts and scalability. Concessional and blended finance models too can provide favourable results while linking these to development objectives of Sri Lanka. In the long term, thematic bonds are also a tool that can be used to mobilise domestic and foreign capital. However, prior to a thematic bond issuance, access to the international finance markets should be established. This is expected to be facilitated by the completion of the IMF programme: A) Debt-for-Climate or Debt-for-Sustainability Swaps This is a financial instrument where the country would swap a promise (repayments on debt) with another promise (such as funding SDGs). Recently, in the aftermath of Sri Lanka\u2019s default, a global financial firm too expressed interest in restructuring USD 1 billion of debt for environmental purposes. Under a bilateral debt swap a debtor country and a creditor involve the cancellation or reduction of a portion of the debt in exchange for the debtor\u2019s commitment to invest in sustainability projects. For example, Sri Lanka could look to negotiate with China (one of its largest bilateral creditors), to swap some of its debt for investments in protecting its forests, wetlands and coral reefs, which are rich in biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services. This would reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s debt burden and free up fiscal space for other development priorities, while also enhancing its resilience. Other Country Experience In 2021, Belize swapped USD 553 million (total external commercial debt) through a blue bond arranged by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to the Belize government to finance a bond-for-cash exchange at 55 cents per dollar. This was in exchange for a 20-year commitment to expand and strengthen its marine protected area. The US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance for the blue bond. In 2022, Barbados swapped USD 150 million of sovereign debt with guarantees from the Inter- American Development Bank (IDB) and TNC to protect 30 per cent of the waters surrounding the island following a similar model of Belize. In 2023, Ecuador swapped USD 1.6 billion of the country\u2019s debt for conservation in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. To date, this is the largest debt-for-nature swap completed in the world. It consisted of an USD 85 million IDB guarantee and an USD 656 million DFC political-risk insurance. B) Carbon Credits Carbon credits are certificates that represent a reduction or avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions. It allows countries or entities that reduce their emissions below a certain level to sell their surplus emission reductions (or carbon credits) to countries or entities that need to comply with their emission targets or voluntarily offset their emissions. This can lower the cost of compliance for buyers and generate additional income for sellers. The Paris Agreement has introduced a new mechanism for international cooperation on climate action, known as Article 6. This mechanism allows countries to cooperate in achieving their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) through various approaches, such as bilateral or multilateral agreements, or carbon pricing instruments.

According to the World Energy Investment report, the global energy crisis that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine , as well as the growing affordability of renewables , has given rise to more sustainable alternatives, sparking a rise in investments. \u201cClean energy is moving fast \u2013 faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol in an IEA press release . \u201cFor every dollar invested in fossil fuels, about 1.7 dollars are now going into clean energy. Five years ago, this ratio was one-to-one. One shining example is investment in solar, which is set to overtake the amount of investment going into oil production for the first time.\u201d In 2023, approximately $2.8 trillion will be invested in energy globally, the report said. More than $1.7 trillion of that amount is projected to be invested in green energy technologies like electric vehicles (EVs), renewables, power grids, nuclear energy , heat pumps , low-emissions fuels and improvements in energy efficiency. The remaining more than $1 trillion will be invested in gas , oil and coal . Yearly investments in renewables are predicted to increase by 24 percent from 2021 to 2023, while fossil fuel investments are expected to rise just 15 percent. Advanced economies, as well as China , are responsible for more than 90 percent of the growth, which could jeopardize global energy equality if green energy investment increases aren\u2019t seen in other parts of the world. \u201cWeak grid infrastructure is a limiting factor for renewable investment in many developing economies, and here too current investment flows are highly concentrated. Advanced economies and China account for 80% of global spending and for almost all of the growth in recent years,\u201d the report said. Renewable energy technologies are projected to make up nearly 90 percent of power generation investment this year, led by solar energy . Investments in solar are expected to reach more than $1 billion per day this year, for a total of $382 billion in 2023, reported Reuters. Oil production investment is projected to be $371 billion. \u201cThis crowns solar as a true energy superpower. It is emerging as the biggest tool we have for rapid decarbonisation of the entire economy,\u201d said Dave Jones, energy think tank Ember\u2019s head of data insights, as Reuters reported. EV sales are projected to rise by one-third in 2023, following a jump last year, the press release said. Since 2021, sales of heat pumps worldwide have also grown by double digits. New initiatives like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and policies in Europe, China, Japan and other countries, as well as phases of vigorous economic growth coupled with unstable fossil fuel prices have helped prompt investments in clean energy. Oil and gas upstream spending is projected to increase by seven percent this year, primarily by large Middle Eastern national oil companies. New fossil fuel investments will increase by six percent to $950 billion this year, according to the IEA report. The increase in fossil fuel investments will lead to levels this year that are more than twice where they need to be in 2030 to be on track for the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario laid out by the IEA, the press release said. Last year, demand for coal was at a record high. In 2023, investment in coal is on a trajectory for a six-fold increase over the levels forecast to reach net zero goals for 2030. \u201cInvestment in coal supply is expected to rise by 10% in 2023, and is already well above pre-pandemic levels. Investment in new coal-fired power plants remains on a declining trend, but a warning sign came in 2022 with 40 GW of new coal plants being approved \u2013 the highest figure since 2016,\u201d the report said. The largest green energy investment deficiencies were found to be in developing and emerging nations. Higher interest rates, weak grid infrastructure, high capital costs, obscure policy rules and strained utilities have hampered investments in renewables in those countries. \u201cThe irony remains that some of the sunniest places in the world have the lowest levels of solar investment,\u201d Jones said, as reported by Reuters.

Coupled with high humidity, the high temperatures make people uncomfortable and sweaty. This year, the Department of Meteorology went so far as to issue heat warnings for several districts, cautioning residents against exposure to high heat that can have harmful health implications. As neighboring South Asian countries are scorched by a severe heat wave, the unusually high-temperature rise is impacting people and their daily lives, a change that causes worry among locals about climate risk. \u201cAs the temperature has risen to about 36 degrees Celsius [96.8 degrees Fahrenheit], Sri Lanka has experienced about 3 degrees Celsius [5.4 degrees Fahrenheit] increase of the daily maximum temperature during the recent heat stress period,\u201d says Shiromani Jayawardena , the deputy director of the Department of Meteorology . Exposure to excessive heat along with high humidity may prove stressful to the body and in extreme cases can even kill, so the department assesses the situation and issues warnings to the public to remain cautious, Jayawardena said. This year, an unusual heat wave with high temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius impacted South and Central Asia. As Sri Lanka is an island, it did not have the same impacts as neighboring countries, but climate models project risks of similar heat waves after 2030 under emission projections, Jayawardena told Mongabay. Increased heat stress is an indication of climate change, and a recent study found that deadly heat stress is becoming a common occurrence across South Asia even with 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) global warming. Lareef Zubair , a scientist at the Foundation for Environment, Climate, and Technology ( FECT ) said heat stress in Sri Lanka is rising to dangerous levels for a larger share of the population due to climate change. Sri Lankans are now experiencing more warm nights\u00a0compared with cold nights. A study found that annually averaged mean minimum temperatures are increasing, reducing the gap between maximum and minimum temperatures. Temperatures in Sri Lanka have been rising faster than the global average at about 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.24 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade, Zubair said. \u201cBy 2019, 2020 and 2022, The heat stress reached risk levels particularly in low elevation parts of Sri Lanka from April to June and this is a clear indication of the role of warming temperatures,\u201d Zubair said. The data also indicate that the number of days the heat index reaches \u201cextreme caution\u201d levels is on the rise, the climate scientist said. Urbanized areas are more prone to excessive heat due to the heat island effect in which human activities make the urban environment significantly warmer than rural areas, said Erandathie Lokupitiya , a professor of environmental science at the University of Colombo. \u201cIn an urban setting, there are buildings, tarred roads and cemented pavements which can absorb heat and then release them,\u201d she said. Studies also show how the heat in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial capital, has risen over time. In this era of climate change, cities should be designed strategically to mitigate increasing threats emanating from heat stresses, said Jagath Munasinghe , an urban planner at the University of Moratuwa. \u201cThere are wind corridors that can help to naturally cool the urban environment, reducing the heat through a natural windfall. Colombo is a coastal town, so there is sea breeze that can help build strong wind tunnels if planned carefully,\u201d Munasinghe said. Air flows to , wetlands and open spaces father inland that could receive continuous airflow. It could provide an effective method to reduce the city\u2019s heat, Munasinghe told Mongabay. The plants are nature\u2019s air purifiers, as their evaporation adds water vapor to the atmosphere. But urban areas are rapidly losing greenery, making them unhealthy and uncomfortable to live in, so regreening cities should become a priority, Munasinghe said. \u201cTrees can be planted along the wind corridors, so the air will get naturally cool,\u201d Munasinghe said. Greening cities has multiple advantages, but vegetation should be planted well based on a feasibility study to make it sustainable, he added. Not only humans but animals, plants and ecosystems should brace for the inevitable impacts from increased heat stress. \u201cThe impact would be more for smaller animals; for example, it is estimated that a small increase in temperature could wipe out some insects and sensitive animals,\u201d Lokupitiya said. However, corals may be the most impacted by such heat stress, as higher ocean temperatures can make corals bleach and die. \u201cMay and June are the months when corals get bleached due to increased temperature resulting from extreme heat. These delicate organisms get severely impacted by heat stress,\u201d said Arjan Rajasuriya , a coral scientist and a former researcher at the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency . Some corals revive and are resilient to heat stress, but in a prolonged event, more corals bleach. The impact could be worse for corals in shallower seas and those in areas where water is stagnated, Rajasuriya added. Sri Lanka needs more research to analyze the possible impacts of such heat stress and overall impacts of climate change, said Devaka Weerakoon , fauna coordinator for the IUCN Red List. The impacts of the changing climate could be greater along the borders of the country\u2019s climatic zones, so more studies are required to project the possible impacts of climate change on living organisms, Weerakoon told Mongabay.

Coupled with high humidity, the high temperatures make people uncomfortable and sweaty. This year, the Department of Meteorology went so far as to issue heat warnings for several districts, cautioning residents against exposure to high heat that can have harmful health implications. As neighboring South Asian countries are scorched by a severe heat wave, the unusually high-temperature rise is impacting people and their daily lives, a change that causes worry among locals about climate risk. As the temperature has risen to about 36 degrees Celsius 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit, Sri Lanka has experienced about 3 degrees Celsius 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit increase of the daily maximum temperature during the recent heat stress period, says Shiromani Jayawardena , the deputy director of the Department of Meteorology . Exposure to excessive heat along with high humidity may prove stressful to the body and in extreme cases can even kill, so the department assesses the situation and issues warnings to the public to remain cautious, Jayawardena said. This year, an unusual heat wave with high temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius impacted South and Central Asia. As Sri Lanka is an island, it did not have the same impacts as neighboring countries, but climate models project risks of similar heat waves after 2030 under emission projections, Jayawardena told Mongabay. Increased heat stress is an indication of climate change, and a recent study found that deadly heat stress is becoming a common occurrence across South Asia even with 1.5 degrees Celsius 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit global warming. Lareef Zubair , a scientist at the Foundation for Environment, Climate, and Technology  FECT  said heat stress in Sri Lanka is rising to dangerous levels for a larger share of the population due to climate change.

These men included former premiers Yasuhiro Nakasone, Noboru Takeshita, Fumio Kishida, Shigeru Ishiba, Naoto Kan and Shinzo Abe. Nevertheless, the Diet seems to be under the spell of the LDP, which has occupied government benches for most of the past 70 years \u2013 and it has even elected the nation\u2019s first female Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Of late however, the Jimint\u014d (as it is known) appears to have lost much of its political lustre among voters due to financial scandals, a disunited leadership and national economic losses. Ishiba\u2019s recent resignation saw the party being forced to form a precarious minority government in October with the Japan Innovation Party (JIP) after the Buddhist backed Komeito \u2013 a party of self-proclaimed \u2018humanitarian socialism\u2019 \u2013 pulled out of the governing alliance. Though JIP will sit with the government, it will not serve in Takaichi\u2019s cabinet. CLAIM TO FAME As soon as Takaichi won the leadership of the LDP \u2013 and subsequently, the nation \u2013 her past role as a heavy metal drummer during her college days was the first item of interest to be published by media houses throughout the world. Her political career has been and continues to be ultraconservative however, even though the Jimint\u014d calls itself a \u2018liberal coalition.\u2019 The JIP is certainly not liberal: it remains a conservative, centre right to right-wing populist political party. But the humanitarian socialist Komeito, which withdrew from the government alliance, had a more dovish and centrist approach. Although the LDP leans towards traditional conservative policies such as low taxes and minimal restrictions on businesses, it supports a strong welfare state. However, Takaichi is a strong advocate for self-reliance through economic growth and incentives, and has been extremely critical of policies that promote dependency. She favours the Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which promotes deficit spending on issues that the government considers important. This is contrary to mainstream neoclassical economics that perceives government debt and deficits as significant constraints, which require careful management. Takaichi is also a firm follower of former prime minister Abe\u2019s leadership style, and has been pushing for the government to play a more assertive role in Japan\u2019s military and revision of Article 9 of the constitution, which renounces war as a sovereign right and prohibits the maintenance of a military force with the potential for armed conflict. She is also a regular visitor to the Yasukuni Shrine, which was founded in 1869 by Emperor Meiji to commemorate those who died serving their nation. This is a controversial place for the Chinese, as well as North and South Koreans, since it also honours 14 convicted Class A Japanese war criminals. These war criminals were enshrined during a secret ceremony in 1978 by the shrine\u2019s chief priest, former naval officer Nagayoshi Matsudaira, after he rejected the verdicts handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) \u2013 a.k.a. the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. RIGHT-WING TILT Takaichi favours ultraconservative policies on many social issues including same-sex marriage, female succession to the imperial throne, revisiting Article 9 of Japan\u2019s constitution and strengthening that country\u2019s alliance with the US. She also promotes a nationalistic perspective of Japanese history and favours rewriting it. Takaichi has even criticised the Murayama Statement of 1995, which apologises for her country\u2019s wartime atrocities and colonial rule, and the Kono Statement of 1993 that specifically acknowledges Japan\u2019s role in the coercion and management of \u2018comfort women\u2019 during WWII.

Her cabinet of ministers is still male dominated; although for the sake of tokenism, she has awarded the finance portfolio to Satsuki Katayama and appointed Kimi Onoda as Minister for Economic Security, Foreign Nationals and Immigration. It seems that Takaichi\u2019s hawkish nationalist perceptions won her the backing of the Japan Innovation Party. In spite of it helping her secure a victory however, Takaichi\u2019s alliance is jittery, and she will need to secure the support of opposition parties to pass legislation. This is a serious red flag for the continued duration of her government. As a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Abe, it\u2019s possible that Takaichi will emulate his policies \u2013 particularly with regard to the economy and establishment of a stronger military. But her tenuous grip on power may not enable Japan\u2019s new premier to achieve very much in terms of constitutional amendments. She has always been an ardent admirer of former British prime minister Baroness Margaret Thatcher and her anti-immigration policies.

Its journey from an art toy to a global sensation began with Hong Kong\u2019s long tradition of toy craftsmanship. In the 1970s and \u201980s, its factories were central to toy manufacturing for major brands such as Mattel and Bandai. The industrial base nurtured small, independent studios that experimented with design and production by blending creativity with technical skills. Out of this culture emerged designer Kasing Lung, who created Labubu alongside Howard Lee\u2019s design house How2Work. Their early versions were handmade, hand painted and sold in limited batches. When Chinese toy giant Pop Mart partnered with its creators in 2019, Labubu leapt from niche circles to mainstream fame. Its quirky proportions, mischievous grin, and blend of cute and creepy charm struck a universal chord. Labubu\u2019s success highlights Hong Kong\u2019s enduring influence on toy culture \u2013 a bridge between local artistry and global pop appeal. What began as a small batch figure has become an icon of modern collectibles, which shows that craftsmanship, nostalgia and innovation still have the power to move markets.

Coal power plants are being steadily retired; and in their place wind, solar, hydropower and large-scale battery systems are expanding rapidly. AEMO predicts that around 90 percent of coal generation will be gone by 2035 with the remainder closing down by the end of the decade. Renewables already make up roughly a third of Australia\u2019s power and on some days, they supply more than three-quarters of national demand. The challenge now lies in maintaining grid stability for services once provided by the heavy spinning turbines of coal power plants. Engineers are responding with new solutions such as synchronous condensers, upgraded gas turbines and long duration battery storage. With abundant sunlight, wind resources and widespread rooftop solar, Australia has unique advantages. As coal fades, the nation is crafting a global model for how advanced economies can achieve reliable clean energy. ELECTRIC FERRARI Ferrari is entering the electric age with its first fully electric vehicle (EV) Elettrica \u2013 a model that aims to prove an EV can still feel, sound and drive like a true Ferrari. Set for release next year, the Elettrica will feature four electric motors that produce over 1,000 horsepower and are powered by a 122 kWh battery capable of more than 500 kilometres of range. It\u2019s expected to accelerate from zero to 100 km/h in only 2.5 seconds, matching Ferrari\u2019s top combustion models for raw performance. However, what truly sets this car apart is its approach to sound: rather than relying on artificial audio or digital effects, Ferrari has developed an innovative acoustic system that amplifies the car\u2019s natural mechanical tones. Sensors capture the vibrations and frequencies from the electric motors, then filter and enhance them to create a responsive organic sound that changes with driving intensity. Ferrari says it\u2019s more than a gimmick and represents a continuation of the brand\u2019s legacy of crafting emotion through engineering, ensuring that even in the silent era of EVs, drivers will experience the thrill and character that define the marque.

Its journey from an art toy to a global sensation began with Hong Kongs long tradition of toy craftsmanship. In the 1970s and 80s, its factories were central to toy manufacturing for major brands such as Mattel and Bandai. The industrial base nurtured small, independent studios that experimented with design and production by blending creativity with technical skills. Out of this culture emerged designer Kasing Lung, who created Labubu alongside Howard Lees design house How2Work. Their early versions were handmade, hand painted and sold in limited batches. When Chinese toy giant Pop Mart partnered with its creators in 2019, Labubu leapt from niche circles to mainstream fame. Its quirky proportions, mischievous grin, and blend of cute and creepy charm struck a universal chord. Labubus success highlights Hong Kongs enduring influence on toy culture  a bridge between local artistry and global pop appeal. What began as a small batch figure has become an icon of modern collectibles, which shows that craftsmanship, nostalgia and innovation still have the power to move markets.

Excessive rain and the lack of incentives for new planting activity have further impacted output,\u201d remarks Dr. Kulatunga Rajapaksa. The long gestation period of seven years for rubber trees to mature is another deterrent for potential planters. He avers: \u201cFarmers are unable to earn during those seven years; and without a support mechanism, smallholders simply can\u2019t afford to replant.\u201d \u201cA replanting scheme launched in 2015 covered 5,000 hectares in Monaragala, which yielded positive results and made it the highest rubber producing region. Unfortunately, the government at the time discontinued the scheme without replanting in the next designated area,\u201d he laments. Additionally, excessive rainfall in traditional rubber growing regions reduced the number of tapping days, compelling workers to exit the trade. As a result of these challenges, large companies shifted away from rubber cultivation to palm oil and tea, which have shorter cycles and lower labour costs. RISING IMPORTS Rajapaksa observes: \u201cWith domestic supply collapsing, manufacturers turned to imports to keep factories running. Many invested heavily in machinery and saw no choice but to import natural rubber to sustain operations.\u201d \u201cThis has undermined a key national advantage. Previously, our exports were 100 percent local rubber. Today, a substantial share is imported, depleting foreign exchange reserves,\u201d he maintains. The rubber glove manufacturing segment \u2013 where demand surged during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 has also had to rely on imported latex. DETERRENTS Rajapaksa asserts that \u201chigh energy costs and outdated labour regulations have deterred foreign investors. Rubber manufacturing is energy intensive; and our energy prices are among the highest in the region.\u201d He points out that even if a factory remains closed for a month, kVA charges must still be paid. \u201cWhat incentive is there for investors when we face a labour shortage, lack of local rubber and high energy costs?\u201d he asks. Labour regulations also hinder competitiveness. \u201cWorking on Sundays, which are mandatory holidays, costs a company three times the normal overtime rate \u2013 including an additional day off. No other country has such a system,\u201d he notes. Securing land from the government is another tough proposition, he says: \u201cAccess to industrial land is difficult; and without it, we can\u2019t build the necessary infrastructure.\u201d BOTTLENECKS \u201cTesting is another bottleneck. All buyers demand certifications but accredited laboratories do not exist in this country. This forces exporters to send samples overseas for testing, which is costly. We urge the government to subsidise part of this expense to relieve the burden on exporters,\u201d he states. Infrastructure gaps are equally pressing. \u201cWe need free trade zones with centralised water treatment plants. Each rubber factory cannot afford its own purification system,\u201d Rajapaksa muses. He continues: \u201cAnother obstacle is that Sri Lanka\u2019s FTAs have been poorly negotiated, making quality certification a barrier to trade. Despite the free trade agreements, some countries accept only their own national standards certification, not even European or American standards.\u201d The result, he points out, is that Sri Lanka hasn\u2019t been able to expand exports to such markets. Rajapaksa also highlights the new rules on export proceeds: \u201cThe government now enforces the rule that all export earnings must be brought back within 180 days. That\u2019s a positive move but additional incentives \u2013 such as tax benefits \u2013 could make it more attractive.\u201d And he recalls the convertible rupee account (CRA) system from decades ago: \u201cThe moment foreign exchange was brought in under this account, exporters received a three percent incentive and goods could also be imported. It was well-received by exporters.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, no such incentive exists today, which deters some exporters from repatriating their earnings,\u201d he says. On the other hand, he believes that the digitalisation of customs processes has been a rare success in the export chain. SHORTAGES The industry is also facing a shortage of skilled engineers and technicians. He warns that \u201cwith new taxes biting into middle-class incomes, many professionals are migrating. That\u2019s a huge cost, which the nation can ill afford.\u201d Rajapaksa calls for tax reforms and private universities to retain talent within the country. \u201cOtherwise, our best people \u2013 the ones capable of modernising the industry \u2013 will be gone,\u201d he cautions. Labour regulations concerning night shifts for female workers also need to be updated. \u201cWe must make it easier for women to participate in the workforce,\u201d he adds. REVIVAL Despite the headwinds, exporters continue to uphold global sustainability standards, ensuring there is no child labour while complying with health, social security and environmental parameters. In this regard, Sri Lanka clearly comes out on top. He says: \u201cMost buyers in the industry are demanding the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification \u2013 and some local estates have already earned the certification to remain competitive.\u201d Yet, he worries that \u201cSri Lanka is moving too slowly to comply with the EU\u2019s new deforestation rules. Government action has been slow \u2013 and without certification, buyers simply won\u2019t purchase our products.\u201d Port congestion and shipping delays also undermine Sri Lanka\u2019s aspirations to be a logistics hub. As Rajapaksa notes, \u201ca few months ago, the port faced severe congestion, causing shipping lines to bypass Colombo. Freight costs also remain high. Efficiency must improve and sudden strikes should be avoided \u2013 otherwise, Sri Lanka can never be positioned as a logistics hub.\u201d His prescription for reviving the industry is clear: \u201cWe must replant natural rubber \u2013 now. A clear national plan is needed, including incentives to support smallholders during the seven year gestation period. Without raw materials, there\u2019s no industry.\u201d \u201cAlthough the government recommends local procurement, it hasn\u2019t been made mandatory, which exposes local manufacturers vulnerable to cheaper imports,\u201d he observes.

Yet, he worries that Sri Lanka is moving too slowly to comply with the EUs new deforestation rules. Government action has been slow  and without certification, buyers simply wont purchase our products. Port congestion and shipping delays also undermine Sri Lankas aspirations to be a logistics hub. As Rajapaksa notes, a few months ago, the port faced severe congestion, causing shipping lines to bypass Colombo. Freight costs also remain high. Efficiency must improve and sudden strikes should be avoided  otherwise, Sri Lanka can never be positioned as a logistics hub. His prescription for reviving the industry is clear We must replant natural rubber  now. A clear national plan is needed, including incentives to support smallholders during the seven year gestation period. Without raw materials, theres no industry. Although the government recommends local procurement, it hasnt been made mandatory, which exposes local manufacturers vulnerable to cheaper imports, he observes.

A: In uncertain and rapidly changing economic conditions, businesses must adopt budgeting methods that combine flexibility with financial discipline. The goal is to remain responsive to market shifts while maintaining control over spending and strategic alignment. Effective approaches include rolling forecasts, which are continuously updated to reflect current realities; scenario planning, which uses \u2018what if?\u2019 models to guide proactive decisions; and selective zero based budgeting, where each expense is justified to ensure every cost adds value. Additionally, driver based budgeting links financial plans to key operational drivers for faster responses to change while activity based budgeting allocates resources to activities that directly support strategic goals. Effective budgeting also relies on real-time data tracking, cross functional budget reviews and a data driven culture. Tools such as cash flow dashboards and variance analysis enable evidence based adjustments to sustain performance. By combining structured financial planning with flexibility, adaptive budgeting helps organisations stay disciplined yet nimble, positioning them to thrive amid volatility. Q: Do you believe traditional static budgets are becoming obsolete in today\u2019s business landscape? A: Traditional static budgets are not obsolete but they\u2019re increasingly inadequate in today\u2019s rapidly changing business environment. As volatility, digital disruption and real-time data reshape decision making, companies are shifting towards dynamic and continuous planning models. Static budgets lose relevance because they lock in assumptions for long periods \u2013 often 12 months or more \u2013 while market factors can shift within weeks. They\u2019re also slow to be updated and prone to budget gaming, where departments inflate requests or delay spending, leading to inefficiency and misalignment. While static budgets still promote financial discipline, accountability and regulatory compliance, emerging alternatives \u2013 such as scenario planning, driver based models and agile performance management \u2013 offer greater flexibility. Rather than being replaced, static budgets are now one part of a broader, dynamic financial planning ecosystem, providing long-term direction supported by systems that adapt to changing realities. Q: How has the role of internal audit (IA) evolved from being compliance driven to a strategic business partner? A: The transformation of IA from a compliance function to a strategic business partner marks a major shift in corporate governance \u2013 this is being driven by evolving risks, stakeholder expectations and technology. Traditionally, IA focussed on verifying compliance and internal controls through a checklist driven approach, which is essential but reactive, identifying errors rather than preventing them. Today, a volatile risk environment, digital transformation and growing strategic complexity have redefined IA\u2019s role. It has evolved into a trusted advisor aligned with business strategy, addressing emerging risks, providing forward-looking insights and strengthening governance. The next generation of internal audit will use AI driven risk analytics, deliver real-time assurance, and serve as a strategic intelligence hub connecting governance, performance and innovation. Evolving from policing compliance to enabling performance with assurance, IA now balances independence with strategic influence. Q: What financial indicators should business leaders focus on to make informed strategic decisions? A: In today\u2019s volatile business environment, financial insight has become a true competitive advantage. Paying close attention to financial indicators enables better informed decision making. Modern business leaders must look beyond traditional accounting metrics, and adopt a balanced set of indicators that link strategy, performance and value creation. The best strategic financial leaders integrate profitability, liquidity, efficiency and risk indicators, to guide adaptive, data dri\u00adven decisions. In uncertain markets, agility and insight \u2013 not merely control \u2013 determine resilience. To use these tools effectively, leaders should align KPIs with strategy, leverage real-time dashboards, benchmark performance and run scenario analyses to stay ahead of change. Q: How can the success of women in BPO and accountancy services contribute to economic empowerment? A: The growing participation and success of women in BPO and accounting roles are powerful drivers of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic and social transformation. These sectors not only promote gender equality but also enhance national competitiveness and resilience. The inclusion of women in structured skill based sectors such as BPO and accounting expands the workforce, boosts productivity and contributes directly to GDP growth. As export oriented industries, IT-BPM and financial services benefit from diverse talent, strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s position as a reliable and inclusive outsourcing hub while increasing forex earnings. This expansion of BPO and accounting operations to secondary cities \u2013 along with the rise of remote work \u2013 creates valuable opportunities for women beyond Colombo, encouraging regional growth and reducing urban migration. Women\u2019s income also generates powerful social benefits, empowering households, improving education and health outcomes, and challenging traditional gender norms. Moreover, greater female participation in finance and accountancy strengthens governance, transparency, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, increasing investor confidence and institutional credibility. Ultimately, these sectors support Sri Lanka\u2019s Digital Economy 2030 vision by driving highly skilled inclusive and sus\u00adtaina\u00adble growth.

A: Although the picture is more encouraging than it was several years ago, more needs to be done. Women hold only 13.4 percent of board seats in Sri Lanka \u2013 a figure that remains low when compared to global benchmarks, and even regional peers such as Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. While it is vital to accelerate diversity at board level, appointments must be based on merit rather than tokenism. In some organisations, legacy structures continue to hinder the advancement of women into leadership roles. Moreover, despite high female literacy rates, women\u2019s workforce participation remains notably lower than that of males, which impacts the leadership pipeline. Q: What practical steps should boards and regulators take to accelerate gender diversity at the top? A: Boards and regulators can act as catalysts for change by setting the tone at the top. Introducing voluntary targets or quotas helps create accountability while mandating disclosure on gender representation makes progress measurable and transparent. Beyond policy, boards must actively foster inclusive cultures by reviewing internal frameworks to accommodate flexible work arrangements, particularly for mid-career women. Unconscious bias in recruitment, promotions and evaluations must also be systematically addressed. Equally important is the development of robust talent pipelines through coaching, mentoring and sponsorship. Structured accelerator programmes and succession planning that deliberately include female talent ensure sustaina\u00adbility. Tools such as curated directories of female professionals with board potential, along with closer collaboration with regulators to strengthen gender provisions in corporate governance frameworks, can help move the country from conversation to action. Q: How do you see emotional intelligence (EI) shaping workplace culture and leadership effectiveness in the banking sector? A: Emotional Intelligence has become a defining trait of successful leadership, particularly in banking, where trust, relationships and service underpin operations. Leaders with strong EI demonstrate self-awareness and empathy, enabling them to respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively in high-pressure situations. At an organisational level, emotional intelligence drives effective communication, reduces misunderstandings, and builds a culture of respect and engagement. In a sector often associated with stress and long hours, EI also plays a key role in reducing burnout and strengthening resilience \u2013 traits that are essential for building sustainable workplace cultures. Q: What are the most pressing operational challenges faced by banks today? A: Operational challenges continue to revolve around balancing modernisation with resource constraints. Many banks still grapple with outdated legacy systems, which complicates the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. Integration is both costly and resource intensive, limiting the ability to scale digital solutions across all functions. Cybersecurity has emerged as another major challenge with threats growing more complex, placing pressure on banks to continually upgrade their defences. Simultaneously, customer expectations are rapidly evolving, shaped by global digital first experiences. Q: How do you view digital transformation reshaping back office operations in the next five years? A: Back office functions are undergoing a fundamental shift from being cost centres to value creators. Over the next five years, automation powered by AI and robotic process automation (RPA) will handle repetitive tasks such as reconciliations, compliance checks and routine reporting. However, true digital transformation also requires investing in people. Upskilling and reskilling initiatives coupled with continuous learning ecosystems will be critical. Inclusive training programmes must ensure that employees at all levels remain relevant and confident about adopting new tools, embedding innovation into the organisation\u2019s DNA. Q: What lessons can banks learn from global best practices in risk and controls? A: The global banking sector highlights the importance of a holistic and proactive approach to risk. Clear governance structures, well-defined risk appetite statements and transparent reporting lines are non-negotiable. Risk identification must evolve from a periodic exercise to a continuous organisation wide practice supported by scenario analysis and stress testing. Controls should be seamlessly embedded into daily operations rather than be treated as afterthoughts with technology leveraged to enhance efficiency. A strong risk culture \u2013 driven by tone at the top, reinforced by regular training and supported by clear communication \u2013 ensures that accountability is shared across the organisation rather than siloed within compliance functions. Q: And what leadership qualities are most critical for future banking executives, in your view? A: The banking sector operates in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment, making leadership qualities more critical than ever. Future leaders must demonstrate agility and foresight to anticipate change, as well as adaptability to respond effectively to disruption. Technical knowledge in areas such as digital transformation, cybersecurity and regulatory compliance must be balanced with people centric skills \u2013 for example, emotional intelligence, collaboration and relationship management.

The government\u2019s second budget since taking office a year ago took a broad-based multi-sectoral approach by balancing fiscal discipline with targeted social measures. In many ways, it signalled a transition from crisis recovery to consolidation. Yet as always, implementation remains the ultimate test. FISCAL STRENGTH Sri Lanka\u2019s fiscal turnaround in only three years has been remarkable. In 2022, revenue collapsed to around eight percent of GDP \u2013 among the lowest in Asia. By the end of 2025, the government expects revenue to be close to 16 percent of gross domestic product, which is the highest since 2007. The primary surplus, projected at 2.3 percent of GDP, is now forecast to reach 3.8 percent in this year, surpassing targets under the IMF programme. This overperformance reflects both the steep tax adjustments introduced since 2022 and one-off revenue effects from pent-up demand \u2013 particularly after import restrictions on vehicles and other consumer goods were lifted. But the government rightly recognises that such buoyancy is temporary: the budget projections for 2026 have been revised downwards modestly, anticipating a slowdown in consumption and import related revenue. Even so, the numbers remain above IMF forecasts, suggesting that fiscal stability is firmly entrenched. DIGITALISATION Budget 2026 also underscored the government\u2019s commitment to accelerating digital transformation, and positioning it as a key enabler of public sector efficiency and private sector competitiveness. An e-procurement system is to be introduced shortly to digitise and streamline public procurement processes by enhancing transparency and accountability. By March next year, people will be able to submit their asset declarations digitally, marking another step in governance reform.

Equally significant is the recognition of land management and investment access as binding constraints. The inclusion of the National Land Use Plan and establishment of a digital land registry are direct responses to longstanding private sector concerns.

DELIVERY IS KEY For 2026, the message is clear: execution must outpace promises. In parallel, growth must be inclusive. As the economy shifts from consumption to investment led growth, targeted social and poverty alleviation programmes will be needed to protect vulnerable communities, and ensure a broad-based recovery.

The governments second budget since taking office a year ago took a broad-based multi-sectoral approach by balancing fiscal discipline with targeted social measures. In many ways, it signalled a transition from crisis recovery to consolidation. Yet as always, implementation remains the ultimate test. FISCAL STRENGTH Sri Lankas fiscal turnaround in only three years has been remarkable. In 2022, revenue collapsed to around eight percent of GDP  among the lowest in Asia. By the end of 2025, the government expects revenue to be close to 16 percent of gross domestic product, which is the highest since 2007. The primary surplus, projected at 2.3 percent of GDP, is now forecast to reach 3.8 percent in this year, surpassing targets under the IMF programme. This overperformance reflects both the steep tax adjustments introduced since 2022 and one-off revenue effects from pent-up demand  particularly after import restrictions on vehicles and other consumer goods were lifted. But the government rightly recognises that such buoyancy is temporary the budget projections for 2026 have been revised downwards modestly, anticipating a slowdown in consumption and import related revenue. Even so, the numbers remain above IMF forecasts, suggesting that fiscal stability is firmly entrenched. DIGITALISATION Budget 2026 also underscored the governments commitment to accelerating digital transformation, and positioning it as a key enabler of public sector efficiency and private sector competitiveness. An e-procurement system is to be introduced shortly to digitise and streamline public procurement processes by enhancing transparency and accountability. By March next year, people will be able to submit their asset declarations digitally, marking another step in governance reform.

In the second quarter of 2025, GDP expanded by 4.9 percent year on year and marked the eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Such consistency hadn\u2019t been seen since the 2016/17 period, underscoring a shift from mere stabilisation to a more decisive recovery. The question now is whether this momentum can be transformed into a period of sustained and accelerated growth \u2013 and as such, it\u2019s necessary to examine the latest GDP numbers and consider what they tell us about the country\u2019s economic trajectory. STRONGER PULSE Following two quarters of contraction, the agriculture sector recorded growth in the April-June period with output rising by two percent, compared to a contraction of 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year and 2.2 percent in the last quarter of 2024. Agriculture provided much of the lift, supported by strong harvests in rice, fruits and animal husbandry. However, weaknesses remained in spices and fishing. Following an extended run, the industry sector cooled modestly \u2013 manufacturing contracted slightly as businesses grappled with tariff and trade uncertainties. Yet, this was countered by renewed activity in mining and construction, which signalled investment and infrastructure related work regaining traction. The Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for Construction continues to remain positive and with the resumption of retail construction, this subsector has room to grow further and recover to pre-pandemic levels. Services, which form the bedrock of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, accelerated at its fastest pace since the last quarter of 2021. Tourism, which mirrored 2018 pre-crisis levels, powered growth in transport, warehousing and hospitality. In the meantime, the rebound in construction boosted real estate and related services, while even public administration and defence showed renewed activity after earlier contractions. Wholesale and retail trade improved but still lag behind their long-term average. The other aspect of GDP is to consider it in the context of expenditure, where it\u2019s evident that household consumption averages 60-70 percent of gross domestic product. Weak spending by consumers is a drag on economic growth. However, since last year\u2019s second quarter, household consumption has been consistently positive and one and half to twice the GDP growth witnessed in previous quarters. This signals that consumers are recovering from the crisis and looking to spend more than they did in the past. EXTERNAL DRIVERS Exports, tourism and worker remittances continue to anchor the recovery. Exports of goods were up six percent in the first half of this year, remittances have averaged US$ 650 million a month (which is well above pre-pandemic levels) and tourist arrivals rival the country\u2019s best ever year of 2018. Even lagging sectors such as construction, private investment and credit markets are showing signs of revival with private sector credit growing 20 percent year on year in July. Much of this credit is towards the import of vehicles but the real estate sector is also borrowing heavily. The most encouraging yardstick is the inflow of worker remittances, which rose almost 20 percent during first eight months of 2025 and is on track to achieve its highest level ever. Recent skilled migration and demand from nontraditional high paying markets are key drivers of this growth. US tariffs have also underscored this resilience. Initially imposed with a punishing 44 percent reciprocal tariff in April, Sri Lanka saw a 90 day pause before the United States imposed a 20 percent tariff in August. Crucially, this rate is largely aligned with competitors such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan. As a result, Sri Lanka\u2019s relative export competitiveness remains intact. However, Sri Lanka can\u2019t afford to rest on its laurels with the 5.9 percent growth it has seen in exports. While much of this could be due to inven\u00adtory buildup in countries such as the US, nations such as Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines saw their exports grow between 13 and 15 percent in the first half of 2025. This highlights both the lack of market and product diversification of Sri Lanka\u2019s export basket relative to a country such as Thailand, which is seeing more demand for EV components and processed food. WHAT LIES AHEAD Though manufacturing is vulnerable to external shocks, agriculture is uneven across subsectors and domestic demand still lags in some areas, the persistence of growth is an encouraging sign. With exports, worker remittances and tourism performing strongly, and construction and credit showing renewed energy, the economy is moving towards a more balanced footing. The forthcoming Budget 2026 should help promote more growth and sustain Sri Lanka\u2019s reform path, by unlocking barriers to land, labour and capital.

In the second quarter of 2025, GDP expanded by 4.9 percent year on year and marked the eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Such consistency hadnt been seen since the 201617 period, underscoring a shift from mere stabilisation to a more decisive recovery. The question now is whether this momentum can be transformed into a period of sustained and accelerated growth  and as such, its necessary to examine the latest GDP numbers and consider what they tell us about the countrys economic trajectory. STRONGER PULSE Following two quarters of contraction, the agriculture sector recorded growth in the April-June period with output rising by two percent, compared to a contraction of 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year and 2.2 percent in the last quarter of 2024. Agriculture provided much of the lift, supported by strong harvests in rice, fruits and animal husbandry. However, weaknesses remained in spices and fishing. Following an extended run, the industry sector cooled modestly  manufacturing contracted slightly as businesses grappled with tariff and trade uncertainties. Yet, this was countered by renewed activity in mining and construction, which signalled investment and infrastructure related work regaining traction. The Purchasing Managers Index for Construction continues to remain positive and with the resumption of retail construction, this subsector has room to grow further and recover to pre-pandemic levels. Services, which form the bedrock of Sri Lankas economy, accelerated at its fastest pace since the last quarter of 2021. Tourism, which mirrored 2018 pre-crisis levels, powered growth in transport, warehousing and hospitality. In the meantime, the rebound in construction boosted real estate and related services, while even public administration and defence showed renewed activity after earlier contractions. Wholesale and retail trade improved but still lag behind their long-term average. The other aspect of GDP is to consider it in the context of expenditure, where its evident that household consumption averages 60-70 percent of gross domestic product. Weak spending by consumers is a drag on economic growth. However, since last years second quarter, household consumption has been consistently positive and one and half to twice the GDP growth witnessed in previous quarters. This signals that consumers are recovering from the crisis and looking to spend more than they did in the past. EXTERNAL DRIVERS Exports, tourism and worker remittances continue to anchor the recovery. Exports of goods were up six percent in the first half of this year, remittances have averaged US 650 million a month which is well above pre-pandemic levels and tourist arrivals rival the countrys best ever year of 2018. Even lagging sectors such as construction, private investment and credit markets are showing signs of revival with private sector credit growing 20 percent year on year in July. Much of this credit is towards the import of vehicles but the real estate sector is also borrowing heavily. The most encouraging yardstick is the inflow of worker remittances, which rose almost 20 percent during first eight months of 2025 and is on track to achieve its highest level ever. Recent skilled migration and demand from nontraditional high paying markets are key drivers of this growth. US tariffs have also underscored this resilience. Initially imposed with a punishing 44 percent reciprocal tariff in April, Sri Lanka saw a 90 day pause before the United States imposed a 20 percent tariff in August. Crucially, this rate is largely aligned with competitors such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan. As a result, Sri Lankas relative export competitiveness remains intact. However, Sri Lanka cant afford to rest on its laurels with the 5.9 percent growth it has seen in exports. While much of this could be due to inventory buildup in countries such as the US, nations such as Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines saw their exports grow between 13 and 15 percent in the first half of 2025. This highlights both the lack of market and product diversification of Sri Lankas export basket relative to a country such as Thailand, which is seeing more demand for EV components and processed food. WHAT LIES AHEAD Though manufacturing is vulnerable to external shocks, agriculture is uneven across subsectors and domestic demand still lags in some areas, the persistence of growth is an encouraging sign. With exports, worker remittances and tourism performing strongly, and construction and credit showing renewed energy, the economy is moving towards a more balanced footing. The forthcoming Budget 2026 should help promote more growth and sustain Sri Lankas reform path, by unlocking barriers to land, labour and capital. Spurring investment led export growth through private sector investment zones and digital led productivity incentives are also avenues for expansion. If policies remains consistent and the investment climate improves alongside ongoing structural reforms, Sri Lanka may well sustain this momentum beyond 2025.

So what is this marketing funnel? It\u2019s a linear, predetermined path that leads people from awareness through interest and a desire to action. The goal is to draw attention, build curiosity, stir emotion and convince customers to make a purchase. This method worked well for a long time. Whether it was shopping online or offline, marketers looked at the marketing funnel as a straightforward sequence of steps. However, it seems that those days are over \u2013 because Generation Z is refusing to play along. Due to their need for instant gratification, short attention spans, endless scrolling, feeds and meme loving ways, the old funnel is cracking. Gen Zs are proving that it was built for the old world, not one that has radically different priorities, influences and technology. The path to purchase has blurred because their primary general marketplace \u2013 i.e. social media \u2013 is also where they post life updates, laugh, learn, argue and pass the time. With purchasing tangled up with everything else now, it is no longer a straight path\u2026 it\u2019s an infinite loop of inspiration, exploration, community and loyalty. And the brands that stick are those that get this mix right. INSPIRATION To understand how Gen Z decides, it\u2019s important to start with their constant state of inspiration. In other words, it\u2019s about understanding how social media acts as their main source of inspiration. From fashion and beauty to recipes and lifestyles, inspiration is gathered using their devices. With so much content in the digital space however, marketers are faced with the challenge of attracting their attention and showing up in the right way at the right moment. Influencers, creators and cele\u00adbrities still play a major role in this process. To be honest, their influence is easy to spot; because with one post or concept, a new aesthetic is born before a product can hit the shelves.

EXPLORATION As social media becomes important to the inspiration phase, these platforms assume the next logical step, which is instant gratification and impulse buying \u2013 see it, like it, buy it! This phase is also seeing almost all social media platforms rolling out \u2018in app\u2019 shopping features to facilitate smoother customer experiences. However, this is producing mixed results because Gen Zs aren\u2019t really engaging in impulse buying. They\u2019re investigating and exploring on social media, and seeking details from reviews on quality and more \u2013 and they want these now! They don\u2019t believe in a brand without undertaking their own research. So where do they conduct this research? Anywhere and everywhere online \u2013 including the comments section, which has become the new customer service desk. Brands can capitalise on this by explaining, demonstrating and engaging with reviews rather than simply promoting a product or service. The icing on the cake is that user generated content (UGC) shows how products really look and feel. COMMUNITY The brands that get it right don\u2019t simply sell things \u2013 they build communities. So how does this work? The secret to winning Gen Z shoppers is to make them feel like they belong. For most of them, their favourite brands are those that make them feel like part of a community. Gen Z is always buying into something rather than simply purchasing products. This process triggers loyalty towards the brand; and loyalty is about shared identity rather than repeat purchases.

Ideally, your organisation should have workers at every level reporting to people whose dominion is small enough to enable them to know those who report to them as human beings. The golden rule for all human relationships  which is to treat others as you wish to be treated  is applicable to leadership too but within limits. Although its oversimplified, this is a great improvement over the primitive coercive approaches or the straight reward for desired behaviour approach. Prentice says all of us have known unselfish people who earnestly wished to satisfy the needs of their fellow beings but were remarkably incompetent as executives, or perhaps even as friends or spouses, because it never occurred to them that others had different emotional requirements.

Once considered a timeless store of value, gold has once again proven its dominance not merely as a hedge against inflation but also as a global signal of shifting trust and changing tides in the world economy.

A growing number of emerging market central banks are rewriting that playbook, however; instead of turning to the dollar, they\u2019re increasingly resorting to gold\u2026 by buying and holding it as a secure reserve asset. According to Bloomberg News, the rally in gold reflects deep structural changes in global finance. Silver too has joined the surge and recently reached its highest price (US$ 1.58 a gramme on 22 October) in nearly four decades. But gold\u2019s ascent tells a larger story about confidence, power and the future of global money. Many experts view gold as an indicator of the world\u2019s economic health. Since international divisions are deepening and markets are growing uneasy, gold has once again become the asset of choice. The appeal of gold lies in its simplicity: it is valuable, liquid and universal.

The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) has been particularly strategic, and reduced its dollar reserves by converting them to gold to strengthen its financial autonomy. This shift underscores the country\u2019s long-term ambition to reshape the world monetary order in its favour.

A: In Sri Lanka, the good still scintillates \u2013 cinnamon scented winds, temples and mosques reaching the same sky, calm oceans, and groups of brown skinned people of diverse races, some simply draped, others richly adorned \u2013 yet, all harmonious in colour and spirit. The bad however, creeps in quietly. Promises sour before they ripen and leaders preach unity while tightening invisible chains. A dream of utopia \u2013 where humanity stands as one family, free of boundaries and divisions \u2013 remains the language of poets and the comfort of fairy tales. And the ugly in Sri Lanka is how such sublime notions of harmony are too often overshadowed by racism and social divides. Q: And what are the challenges facing the country today? A: It is difficult to understand the issued facing the nation without acknowledging the three decades of conflict and manner in which it ended. We may welcome the quiet that followed but silence does not erase the scars; the past sits heavy, seeping into politics and trust. The present situation is a product of this history. In addition, there are new complexities such as the impact of the first global pandemic of the Anthropocene era. And today, the country faces another kind of loss \u2013 not on the battlefield but through departures. As skilled professionals in medicine, IT and business leave, in search of stability and opportunity, offices grow emptier and clinics quieter, devoid of the very lifeblood needed for recovery. Q: What are the challenges facing young people in Sri Lanka today? A: Young people walk a narrow bridge. A mismatch between the school curriculum and current labour market demands, limited access to digital tools and resources, the notable digital divide and the gap in mentoring for 21 st century skills \u2013 including digital literacy and innovation form a maze of obsta\u00adcles confronting youth today. Q: So how can our youth contribute to national progress? A: The youth must immerse themselves in something \u2013 a craft, a skill or a field \u2013 until it becomes a part of who they are. In their hands lies hope: that every effort can churn the slow wheels of a nation and mend its frayed edges. Q: What type of leadership do you think the world needs right now? A: The canvas we live in is in urgent need of leaders who don\u2019t avert their eyes. In the malefic malaise of human conflict, the rubble chants louder than the living. Palestine shows us what happens when leadership becomes an exercise in resolutions and condemnations \u2013 gestures that fade like smoke while children sleep beneath shattered roofs. Venom and vengeance know no bounds. Traditions built and nurtured over centuries have taken on a different form; war cries have replaced the sweet lullabies that once laid the young to sleep. And weapons of modern warfare have taken control of the psyche of those in power. The world needs leaders who are ready to carry the weight of human suffering without turning it into a spectacle \u2013 those who believe true authority lies not in domination but in the fragile, stubborn act of protecting dignity where it\u2019s most denied. Q: How has the advent of AI and technology shaped your view of the future? A: AI is a double edged sword. I see tools that connect us and create opportunities once thought impossible. I also see shadows \u2013 human voices drowned out by algorithms and power concentrated in invisible hands. It leaves me both hopeful and uneasy as though we are building the future faster than we\u2019re learning how to live in it. Q: As a young person, what are your hopes for and concerns about the future? A: I hope for a future where progress doesn\u2019t demean the pulse of life \u2013 where ambition and growth coexist with understanding. Yet, I fear a world where we may be lost in the rat race, allowing joy, friendship and meaning to evaporate like mist in a sunless corridor. Q: If you could launch a project or movement in Sri Lanka, what would it be \u2013 and why? A: If I were to launch a movement, it would be to ensure that every overlooked voice is heard.

At this year\u2019s ceremony, held on 17 November 2025 at Cinnamon Life, NDB was recognised among the Ten Best Integrated Reports in Sri Lanka and also secured the position of Runner-Up in the Best Integrated Report \u2013 Banking Sector category. The annual CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards, organised by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA Sri Lanka), is one of the country\u2019s most respected platforms dedicated to advancing best practices in integrated reporting. The awards evaluate how effectively organisations articulate their value creation story, encompassing financial and non-financial performance, long-term strategy, governance, and stakeholder engagement in alignment with globally accepted integrated reporting principles. Reflecting on this recognition, Azzam Ahamat, Vice President \u2013 Finance, stated, \u201cBeing ranked among the Ten Best Integrated Reports and receiving the Runner-Up award in the Banking Sector is a testament to NDB\u2019s continued commitment to transparent, relevant, and high-quality reporting.
