The agreement was signed on December 3 by Treasury Secretary Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma and World Bank\u2019s Division Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka David N. Sislen. The funding marks the first tranche of a US$ 60 million two-phase programme aimed at addressing long-standing grid constraints that have slowed the uptake of renewable power. The government plans to secure the second US$ 30 million tranche from the World Bank in due course. The Treasury said insufficient grid capacity has hindered the country\u2019s ability to absorb renewables, creating technical bottlenecks that undermine the government\u2019s target of sourcing 70 percent of electricity from renewable energy by 2030. The project will support infrastructure upgrades to facilitate renewable integration, strengthen system reliability and reduce the cost of power supply. It will also help mobilise private sector investment through a planned World Bank payment guarantee facility designed to de-risk renewable energy projects According to the statement, the initiative aims to scale up renewable adoption, modernise grid operations, expand private participation, and build institutional capacity to sustain long-term sector reforms. The loan will be on-lent to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which will implement the project in coordination with the Energy Ministry and other agencies, the Department of External Resources said.   222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Security manager at Taj Samudra arrested for assaulting trainees IPL 2026 Auction: 3 Sri Lankans among top INR 2 Crore picks Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now Taj Samudra terminates security officer following internal inquiry Rainfall expected to increase from Thursday DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days Tilvin Silva\u2019s Encounter with the Tamil Diaspora in London Protests by a few sections had no impact Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery      ", "content_hash": "9a1f3270f234e9d5bdb51a67ae8a51e8", "scraped_at": "2025-12-10T16:28:55.767992", "updated_at": "2025-12-10T16:28:55.768005", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online HitAd TimesJobs E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads WNL Home Sri Lanka has signed a US 30 million financing agreement with the International Development Association IDA of the World Bank to upgrade grid infrastructure and accelerate renewable energy integration under the Secure, Affordable, and Sustainable Energy for Sri Lanka Project, the Treasury said on Monday.

Outgoing President Sajith Wijenayake reaffirmed the council\u2019s commitment to strengthening trade and investment ties between Sri Lanka and the Benelux nations. He highlighted the importance of promoting responsible business practices and exploring emerging opportunities in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture. He also emphasised the need to organise a long-overdue business promotion mission to the Netherlands, noting that such an initiative would significantly enhance collaboration and investment prospects.

He highlighted the opportunities to expand trade, tourism, investment and sectoral partnerships across Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. He noted the need for support from the Benelux region in extending the EU Deforestation Regulation SME compliance deadline to December 2026, as many Sri Lankan smallholders require more time to meet the sustainability standards. He also identified the collaboration potential in floriculture and the revival of Sri Lanka\u2019s cocoa industry through investment and technology sharing. Sri Lanka is seeking strengthened cooperation with key European partners to support sectoral development and enhance foreign exchange earnings. Belgium, as a leading global producer of value-added chocolate and major importer of cocoa products, is encouraged to explore opportunities to support cocoa cultivation and development in Sri Lanka. Luxembourg, with its strong IT and logistics capabilities, is also invited to consider partnering with Sri Lanka in developing the island as a regional IT hub and supporting growth in port-related infrastructure. Sri Lanka welcomes the partnership and support of these nations to unlock new opportunities and strengthen economic cooperation.

The estimated damage is said to be over US $ 5 billion. In response, the government has swiftly established the nationwide programme \u2018Rebuild Sri Lanka\u2019 to fast-track the rehabilitation work. Across the country, there is powerful momentum: government agencies mobilising, foreign governments pouring in aid, the armed forces working round the clock, volunteers lining up to help the affected communities and the private sector stepping to support. Rebuilding work has commenced at breakneck speed, roadways are being cleared of debris and repaired, power lines re-erected, water supplies restored and even bridges are being reconstructed. A crash programme to rebuild the destroyed houses is also on the cards. Speed is essential under the circumstances to ensure that food and other essentials can be transported to the needy in the affected areas, which were hitherto isolated and cut off. Immediate relief and the restoration of the basics is of vital importance. Uncomfortable question But within the humanitarian effort this lies an uncomfortable question: Are we only rebuilding what was destroyed or are we rebuilding what never should have existed in that form in the first place? Because there is a fundamental difference between repairing the damage and rebuilding a nation. Speed is necessary but speed without a vision can be dangerous. By rushing into large-scale rebuilding are we risking repeating the single biggest mistake countries make after disaster? Rebuilding exactly what was wrong and failed in the first place and watch it fail again? It is well known that unplanned development, politically motivated settlements and annexing of low-lying lands (especially in the suburbs of Colombo), deforestation, clearing of mangroves, etc. have drastically affected the environmental landscape and the rain water drainage network, which was providing protection from floods. Several dubiously approved development projects have been set up in such environmentally sensitive areas (e.g. Muthurajawela). What about the numerous small houses along the embankment of the Kelani river which are illegally built on the setback from the river? Are we going to restore them and let them flood again at the next big rainfall? The picturesque hill country is dotted with buildings (particularly small hotels) on steep inclines, obstructing the table drains and weep holes, which normally allow for rainwater drainage and seepage, which could then lead to possible landslides. The city of Colombo and its suburbs, with a network of 36 wetlands and nearly 50 km of canals, was recognised by the Ramsar Convention as a globally significant Wetland City in 2018, the only capital with this status in South Asia. Seven years down the line, with illegal settlements and mass unplanned development, I wonder if this accreditation will be still valid? Yes, we need to rebuild fast but we must rebuild better, stronger and smarter. Without a long-term plan, we are simply resetting the clock until the next cyclone, the next flood, the next tragedy. Disasters are sad but they are also opportunities There are enough examples of global disasters that led to genuine transformation. Japan rebuilt after the Kobe earthquake with new building codes and strict engineering standards. New Zealand used the Christchurch earthquake to redesign entire districts with resilience and safety built in. Thailand transformed its disaster management system after the 2004 tsunami into one of Asia\u2019s strongest. Don\u2019t we remember the tsunami and what happened afterwards? Have we not learned enough lessons for tragedies past? Sri Lanka must also ask itself the same question: Will this cyclone be another tragedy or a turning point? A dual strategy is needed: Short term and long term The basics must be restored quickly to stabilise communities and revive economic activity- Electricity, roads and bridges [SM1], potable water supply, essential housing and healthcare services. Simultaneously, a properly planned national development blueprint needs to be prepared for long term (five to 10 years?) This should include new infrastructure standards, stricter engineering codes, climate-resilient design and flood and storm-proof construction. Risky areas and vulnerable slopes need to be identified and excluded from any form of development or rebuilding. Modern hydrological and geotechnical modelling tools must be utilised. Sri Lanka is now facing climate events far more extreme, more frequent and more unpredictable than ever before. If we rebuild the old Sri Lanka, we will inherit old vulnerabilities. Therefore, the opportunity must also be used to put in place a proper climate adaptation policy, including mangrove restoration, reforestation and introducing buffer zones. This disaster must become the catalyst for a policy shift toward resilient infrastructure, evidence-based planning and accountable reconstruction.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Security manager at Taj Samudra arrested for assaulting trainees IPL 2026 Auction: 3 Sri Lankans among top INR 2 Crore picks Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now Taj Samudra terminates security officer following internal inquiry Rainfall expected to increase from Thursday DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days Tilvin Silva\u2019s Encounter with the Tamil Diaspora in London Protests by a few sections had no impact Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery      ", "content_hash": "3fab509b5669a52aad4a610cb3cd4f2b", "scraped_at": "2025-12-10T16:30:33.646384", "updated_at": "2025-12-10T16:30:33.646398", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online HitAd TimesJobs E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads WNL Home By Srilal Miththapala The deadly cyclone that hit Sri Lanka has left in its wake hundreds dead, thousands of houses destroyed and a devastated infrastructure across many parts of the island.

This disaster must become the catalyst for a policy shift toward resilient infrastructure, evidence-based planning and accountable reconstruction. 222 Reply To Name - Reply Comment Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates  Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Security manager at Taj Samudra arrested for assaulting trainees IPL 2026 Auction 3 Sri Lankans among top INR 2 Crore picks Understanding the flood aftermath What Sri Lankans should be aware of now Taj Samudra terminates security officer following internal inquiry Rainfall expected to increase from Thursday DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him sex offender BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days Tilvin Silvas Encounter with the Tamil Diaspora in London Protests by a few sections had no impact Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery", "sentiment_score": -0.007, "sentiment_label": "neutral", "entities": {"PERSON": ["Advertise", "Srilal Miththapala", "Rebuild Sri Lanka", "Muthurajawela", "Kobe", "Landslides", "Sri Lankans", "Taj Samudra", "Rainfall", "Tilvin Silvas Encounter"], "ORG": ["imes Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa", "Archive Print Ads WNL Home", "Colombo", "Kelani", "Ramsar Convention", "International Aid and Government Alerts Security", "aj Samudra", "INR 2", "U.S. Professor", "post-Ditwah"], "GPE": ["Sri Lanka", "US", "Wetland City", "Japan", "New Zealand", "Thailand", "London"], "LOC": ["South Asia", "Christchurch"]}, "keywords": ["protection", "disasters", "a network", "houses", "place", "the river", "roadways", "large-scale rebuilding", "40 countries", "rebuilding work", "many parts", "the kelani river", "thailand", "next few days", "the clock"], "sectors": ["construction"], "language": "en", "word_count": 930, "enriched_at": "2025-12-10T17:08:04.866996"}, "14": {"source": "DailyMirror", "section": "business", "title": "Mark and Comm named as Rest of South Asia PR Agency of the Year 2025", "url": "https://www.dailymirror.lk/business-news/Mark-and-Comm-named-as-Rest-of-South-Asia-PR-Agency-of-the-Year-2025/273-327387", "text": "Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online HitAd TimesJobs E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads WNL Home   Mark and Comm Managing Director Thanzyl Thajudeen receives Rest of South Asia PR Agency of the Year award Mark and Comm, Sri Lanka\u2019s leading boutique public relations and communications agency, has been honoured at Campaign\u2019s Agency of the Year Awards 2025 (South Asia), taking home a Silver award and emerging as the sole agency in the Rest of South Asia PR Agency of the Year category.

The initiative was launched nationwide through Sinopec\u2019s filling stations network located in areas deeply impacted by the disaster. With many parts of the country facing disruptions to essential services, access to safe drinking water has emerged as a priority need. After ensuring uninterrupted fuel supply to its filling station network, Sinopec responded swiftly to the national emergency by activating its flagship CSR programme, Clear Spring, to deliver drinking water to communities in need. Distribution was carried out through filling stations and strategic partners in several of the hardest-hit regions, including Kandy, Badulla, Arachchikattu, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Biyagama, Kaduwela and Kelaniya. In addition, water donations were delivered directly to the offices of the Kandy District Secretariat, Gampola Youth Centre, Kurunegala local government and Pudukkudiyiruppu Divisional Secretariat, supporting broader public sector relief and recovery efforts. The donation drive took on added significance when Energy Minister Kumar Jayakody personally joined the Sinopec staff and volunteers in Biyagama to distribute water packages to the flood-affected families.

The water donation is part of Sinopec\u2019s broader humanitarian response, building on earlier investments under Clear Spring that brought water filtration facilities to underserved areas across the country. Earlier this year, Sinopec installed two filtration units in Madu, Mannar and Anuradhapura and has committed to expanding this effort by identifying and deploying additional units in the future.

The list size was increased to recognise 20 organisations that promote trust, respect and opportunities for female talent, inspiring broader adoption of inclusive workplace practices. Now in its seventh consecutive year, the study reflects participation from over 95,000 employees, including 43,000 women, across 150+ assessments conducted between July 2024 and August 2025. Only organisations with a valid one-year Great Place To Work Certification during this period were eligible for selection, ensuring that all nominees meet the minimum global threshold in employee trust levels. The 20 Best Workplaces for Women 2025, in alphabetical order, include AB Mauri Lanka, AIA Insurance Lanka, AmSafe Bridport, Ansell Textiles Lanka, ATG Hand Care, BoardPAC, Diamond Cutters, Dole Lanka, EFL 3PL, EWIS Colombo, Hayleys Plantations, Hilton, HNB Assurance, Intrepid Colombo, ITX360, Marriott International, Omega Line, Oxford College of Business, SYNERGEN Health and Uzabase. The Great Place To Work For All model determines the Best Workplaces using two main components: the Trust Index and Culture Audit. The Trust Index, which contributes 65 percent of the overall score, gathers anonymous employee feedback on trust, pride and camaraderie, with post-survey audits including random calls to ensure reliability and integrity of the results. The Culture Audit, accounting for the remaining 35 percent, assesses organisational practices that foster a positive workplace environment. To qualify for evaluation, organisations must achieve at least 70 percent positive employee experience, employ a minimum of 20 female staff members representing 10 percent or more of the workforce and implement practices that actively encourage belonging in the workplace. Key insights from the 2025 study reveal that the overall positive experience of women in the Best Workplaces is 94 percent, reflecting a one percent increase from 2024. Among women in both Best and Rest organisations, pride in corporate image is the highest scoring area, where as impartiality remains the lowest-scoring metric, with the Best outperforming the Rest by 20 percent points. Additionally, for women in the Best Workplaces, Manager Role Modelling emerges as the primary driver of emotional connection with the organisation, highlighting the critical role of leadership in developing a supportive and inclusive culture. \u201cRecognising the Best Workplaces for Women is more than a celebration\u2014it\u2019s a call to action. When we assess workplace culture through the lens of women\u2019s experiences, we uncover the practices that foster equity, belonging and opportunity. A truly great workplace ensures that women not only have a seat at the table but a voice that\u2019s heard, valued and empowered to lead,\u201d said Great Place To Work Sri Lanka Director and CEO Kshanika Ratnayaka. This year, the Best Workplaces for Women 2025 celebrates outstanding achievement and sets the stage for workplaces to raise the bar in creating, inclusive and empowering workplaces, driving innovation by all through high trust culture and shaping Sri Lanka into a great place to work for women.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Security manager at Taj Samudra arrested for assaulting trainees IPL 2026 Auction: 3 Sri Lankans among top INR 2 Crore picks Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now Taj Samudra terminates security officer following internal inquiry Rainfall expected to increase from Thursday DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days Tilvin Silva\u2019s Encounter with the Tamil Diaspora in London Protests by a few sections had no impact Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery      ", "content_hash": "b691dc3111ac52c5735ec655ea97e4c5", "scraped_at": "2025-12-10T16:31:16.570297", "updated_at": "2025-12-10T16:31:16.570306", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online HitAd TimesJobs E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads WNL Home Great Place To Work Sri Lanka recently announced the Best Workplaces for Women 2025, spotlighting organisations whose own employees validate them to be fostering inclusive, empowering and supportive work environments for women.

The strategic shift was disclosed alongside the company\u2019s annual report for the 2024/25 financial year, where Odel reported a net loss of Rs.4.45 billion. Independent auditors Ernst & Young raised a red flag on the company\u2019s financial health, citing a \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d regarding its ability to continue as a going concern, due to the accumulated losses of Rs.12.7 billion and current liabilities exceeding the current assets by Rs.15.2 billion. In a major strategic shift concerning its mixed development project in Ward Place, Odel announced that the originally planned residential apartment component of Odel Mall will no longer proceed. The management has decided to repurpose the space allocated for apartments into rentable office space. The decision reflects a move to \u201cderisk\u201d the project, with the company noting that office space offers a more predictable revenue stream and lower development risks compared to the volatile residential market. The revised scope is also expected to reduce the overall funding requirement for the project, which currently carries a capital work-in-progress value of Rs.17.8 billion. To complete the construction of Odel Mall under this revised design, the company plans to raise Rs.4.5 billion in new funding. The financing strategy for the project has been updated to rely on advances from office space sales supplemented by external equity. This pivot is part of a wider remedial plan announced by Odel to address the negative working capital position that triggered its transfer to the Watch List. In addition to the mall completion, the plan includes adopting dynamic marketing strategies to boost footfall, closing the underperforming stores to reduce overheads and evaluating alternative financing sources. Crucially, the Softlogic group is actively seeking potential equity partners to infuse fresh capital into its retail sector, including the Odel group. On the debt front, the company is heavily leveraged, with total interest-bearing borrowings standing at Rs.20.77 billion as of March 31, 2025. A significant portion of this debt is tied to the Odel Mall project through a syndicated loan facility involving Hatton National Bank (HNB), Sampath Bank and Bank of Ceylon, with a balance of approximately Rs.8.2 billion. To manage this burden, Odel is actively renegotiating the debt repayment plans. The company revealed that the consortium of banks led by HNB has \u201cresponded positively\u201d and is currently evaluating the restructuring options for the syndicated loan and accrued interest. This restructuring is intended to align debt service commitments with the updated timeline of the mall project. Despite the financial strain, Odel\u2019s operational performance has shown signs of resilience. In the six months ended September 30, 2025, the group revenue grew to Rs.3.3 billion, up from Rs.2.7 billion in the same period the previous year. The company has also been aggressively rationalising its footprint, closing 17 underperforming outlets during the last financial year while opening new value-focused \u2018ODEL Brands Outlet Stores\u2019 to cater to the price-sensitive consumers.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Security manager at Taj Samudra arrested for assaulting trainees IPL 2026 Auction: 3 Sri Lankans among top INR 2 Crore picks Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now Taj Samudra terminates security officer following internal inquiry Rainfall expected to increase from Thursday DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days Tilvin Silva\u2019s Encounter with the Tamil Diaspora in London Protests by a few sections had no impact Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery      ", "content_hash": "0889636918514c91fc3417b4f5adaf70", "scraped_at": "2025-12-10T16:32:03.226949", "updated_at": "2025-12-10T16:32:03.226961", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online HitAd TimesJobs E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads WNL Home By Nishel Fernando Odel PLC has scrapped plans for luxury apartments at its flagship Odel Mall project in Ward Place, pivoting instead to office space as part of a broader remedial strategy to address severe financial headwinds that have seen the retailer placed on the Colombo Stock Exchanges Watch List.

These assessments will guide the targeted relief interventions required for the export sector. The Chairman of the Export Development Board emphasized that strategic interventions are actively underway to tackle immediate challenges facing the export sector. These measures focus on minimizing disruptions to export operations to ensure a steady flow of goods and services to international markets. Additionally, efforts are being made to mitigate the adverse impact on production capacity, safeguarding the ability of exporters to maintain output levels. A key priority is also placed on reactivating disrupted supply chains, restoring the seamless connectivity essential for efficient production and export processes. Through these targeted actions, the EDB aims to sustain export growth and build resilience against short-term obstacles. The EDB is currently working closely with customs, port authorities, and logistics providers to manage infrastructure delays caused by adverse weather conditions and expedite export-related clearances. Special government attention has now been focused on assisting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in particular to rapidly reactivate their operational capacity during this recovery process. The discussion highlighted the growing intensity and frequency of climate-related challenges in recent times, underscoring the urgent need for proactive and sustainable responses. It was emphasized that addressing these environmental issues is not only critical for mitigating risks but also essential for ensuring long-term economic resilience. By integrating sustainability into export practices and promoting green technologies, the EDB aims to strengthen the export sector\u2019s competitiveness and sustainability. This approach seeks to support exporters in adapting to climate realities while fostering greener and more resilient trade pathways that align with global environmental goals.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Security manager at Taj Samudra arrested for assaulting trainees IPL 2026 Auction: 3 Sri Lankans among top INR 2 Crore picks Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now Taj Samudra terminates security officer following internal inquiry Rainfall expected to increase from Thursday DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days Tilvin Silva\u2019s Encounter with the Tamil Diaspora in London Protests by a few sections had no impact Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery      ", "content_hash": "7ee43b3ea2f611e861abca166cc4e664", "scraped_at": "2025-12-10T16:32:20.052424", "updated_at": "2025-12-10T16:32:20.052432", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online HitAd TimesJobs E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads WNL Home The Export Development Board EDB has launched a rapid relief and recovery programme following the severe impact of adverse weather conditions on Sri Lankas export sector.

REPA and other groups warned that this move could deter local investors and hinder the growth of the renewable energy sector. They emphasised the importance of energy supply for economic development and urged the Government to support sustainable energy initiatives. Darshana Liyanasekara, Chairman of REPA, highlighted the numerous benefits of renewable energy. He explained that generating and using sustainable energy aligns with global goals and fosters international cooperation. \u201cSolar power is highly feasible due to consistent sunlight and ample space for installation. It involves low investment and maintenance costs, minimal foreign exchange flow, and remains eco-friendly. The revenue stays within the country, boosting the local economy and creating jobs. Solar power supports the 2050 zero carbon energy goals, reduces production costs for local industries, and is crucial for meeting the 70 percent renewable energy target by 2030,\u201d he said. REPA Secretary Amal Sarathchandra addressed challenges in promoting solar energy. He noted that local investors are discouraged by unfair price revisions and delays in project approvals. \u201cTrust is further undermined by the suspension of new project contracts and inadequate support for existing installations,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial relief is hard to obtain, and the tax system imposes taxes on solar devices like panels and inverters.\u201d REPA Vice President Suresh Galanga emphasised the need to support local investors. He argued that while foreign investment offers temporary capital, it has long-term financial drawbacks, similar to foreign debt. \u201cMoney paid for electricity from foreign projects flows out of the country, much like diesel and coal expenditures,\u201d he said. \u201cEncouraging local investors through prioritised procurement guidelines and support is vital to revitalising the renewable energy sector.\u201d Chanaka Jayawardena, REPA\u2019s Treasurer said that boosting renewable energy generation, including solar power, would greatly benefit the country economically, given the high costs of fuel-based power generation. \u201cIn 2022 and 2023, Rs. 203.7 billion and Rs. 278.9 billion were spent on fuel-based power generation, respectively. This expenditure threatens the economy in both the short and long term. Installing 1,000 megawatts of solar power could add 1,320 gigawatt hours per year at a cost of Rs. 48.8 billion, while generating the same capacity with diesel would cost Rs. 92.4 billion.\u201d Electricity Consumers\u2019 Association President M.D.R.

The announcement made yesterday brings the much-needed financial support to industries and hotels. After having lobbied for lower electricity costs, the PUCSL\u2019s decision comes as a welcome change. Under the new tariff structure, hotels will be able to reap the benefit of a 26 percent reduction, while industries will see a 25.3 percent decrease. The overall reduction in electricity tariffs stands at 22.49 percent. The new rates are effective from today, July 16. The move is a notable shift from the series of tariff hikes imposed, which saw electricity costs soar by as much as 400 percent. The hike made it increasingly difficult for the industrial and tourism sectors to stay afloat. The tourism sector, which had managed to be categorised under the \u2018industry category\u2019 for electricity tariffs, after several episodes of tariff increases found itself paying exorbitant rates as it did when under the \u2018super-tariff\u2019 scheme. The private sector has been vocal about the overestimated tariff forecasts by the Ceylon Electricity Board, which led to unnecessarily high retail and industrial tariffs. However, their concerns did not receive much attention until now. Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel sector, a major contributor to the nation\u2019s export revenue, has repeatedly emphasised the need for a rigorous implementation of a least-cost generation plan. This, it argues, is essential for Sri Lanka to stay competitive, with the regions adopting low-cost generation and offering lower tariffs without subsidies. The sector also urged for power purchase agreements to be based on cutting-edge technology, with price discovery conducted through transparent competitive bidding. There is a strong call for policies that support the scaling up of renewable energy, including rooftop solar, in line with the government\u2019s goal of generating 70 percent of the country\u2019s energy from renewable sources by 2030. With increasing pressure from global brands for the decarbonisation of supply chains, Sri Lanka must move swiftly in adopting renewable energy solutions but at competitive prices, it said. 1 2 3 4 5  10 Dec 2025 12 minute ago 10 Dec 2025 26 minute ago 10 Dec 2025 29 minute ago 10 Dec 2025 54 minute ago 10 Dec 2025 57 minute ago General : +94 0115 335 731 +94 0112 304 545 Circulation : +94 0112 479 611 Advertising : +94 0112 479 561 Subscription : +94 0112 479 626 Technical : +94 011 538 3437 helpdesk@wijeya.lk All the content on this website is copyright protected and can be reproduced only by giving the due courtesy to 'dailymirror.lk' Copyright \u00a9 2004 Wijeya Newspapers Ltd.", "content_hash": "84fa02a0f3579210fec7aba8bbc08326", "scraped_at": "2025-12-10T16:33:54.736917", "updated_at": "2025-12-10T16:52:23.309633", "update_count": 1, "text_cleaned": "Daily Mirror - Print Edition Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads Wed, 10 Dec 2025 Todays Paper 16 Jul 2024 - 983 Sri Lankas commercial sector can breathe a sigh of relief as the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka PUCSL approved the awaited reduction in electricity tariffs.

While southern resorts have been largely unaffected by the crisis, the problem areas are the hill country and the Northcentral Province. All tourist sites have been closed since Thursday while some travellers are considering postponing their visit plans. Some resort properties in Nuwara Eliya had been damaged while the rooms of a hotel in Kandy had been flooded forcing about 35 guests to be shifted to the bar area. At the moment tourist arrivals are being postponed without any further notice since accessibility to hotels (particularly to the hill country) have been blocked as roads are flooded, Nuwara Eliya Hotels Association former President Shaam Weerasooriya has said. But these postponements will not be subjected to any charges. Meanwhile, travellers already in the country on tour or just arrived have been taken to safe hotels and transit hotels. Mr. Weerasooriya said some travellers have been placed in hotels somewhere closer to Colombo like the transit hotels as these places are functioning well especially the city hotels. Transportation is also provided to these locations in which areas the roads are accessible. Some tourists have also been placed in hotels in Kandy that are currently full due to their inability to go further to hotels like in Nuwara Eliya. Hotels in Nuwara Eliya have been in touch with travel agents and tour guides to establish communication with their guests and ensure their safety while touring or visiting the country, Mr. Weerasooriya said. He noted that the hotels are very safe and that the transportation systems are safe as well and a system to protect travelers when moving from one place to another. The Tourist Police has also been located in almost all police stations in areas where travelers are lodging to ensure their safety. Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators President Nalin Jayasundere said that they are ensuring the safety of all travellers and not taking any risks since certain roads are not passable. However, he noted there are no cancellations at present. Sri Lanka is reportedly facing the worst climatic conditions with incessant rains and strong winds resulting in 56 deaths, 14 injured and 21 displaced as at 9 am on Friday according to the Disaster Management Centre. This stormy weather named Ditwa has impacted 20 districts in the country. So far the main rivers have overflowed causing a flood situation in most areas and as a result of the heavy rains earth slips and landslides have been reported from a number of hilly areas due to which roads and railway lines have hampered travel to and from a number of districts. The crisis comes just as Sri Lanka is targeting 2.3-2.5 million tourists in 2025.

The move, approved by Cabinet in November 11, comes after the Central Bank flagged serious concerns about the long-term survival of both institutions. Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe did not mince words this week when he described the two specialised lenders as \u201cburdened with unsustainable business models, poor profitability and an inability to meet minimum capital requirements\u201d. Speaking at a media briefing, he said the regulator had drawn up a \u201ctargeted consolidation plan\u201d focusing on smaller banks to safeguard financial sector stability and protect depositors. According to the plan, the government\u2019s entire shareholding in HDFC incorporated under the Housing Development Finance Corporation Act of 1997 will be transferred to Bank of Ceylon (BOC), which will operate HDFC as its subsidiary.\u00a0 The State Mortgage and Investment Bank, established in 1975, will become a subsidiary of People\u2019s Bank (PB) under a similar transfer of state-owned shares. Dr. Weerasinghe highlighted that both HDFC and SMIB had \u201clow risk densities due to their heavy reliance on Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF)-backed loans\u201d, which carry zero risk-weighting but also reflect the narrowness of their loan books. Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings, in its latest review, supported this view, noting that the proposed transfers are unlikely to affect the ratings of BOC or PB. Several financial and banking analysts fear that once absorbed into larger banks, low-income housing borrowers traditionally served by these institutions could be de-prioritised in favour of more commercially attractive segments.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a warning to the public of a scam by this company noting that it is not licenced by the SEC and has no authority to trade in securities on behalf of investors.

Officials at the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) told The Sunday Times Business that they were able to control the spread of the disease by taking the right measures and cutting down the affected trees. It was noted that there was no medication or chemical that could be used to eradicate this disease that had affected some coconut trees in the Galle, Weligama and parts of Hambantota district. The only solution for the eradication of the disease was to cut down the tress and then destroy them where the insects are found. Officials note that no medical solution had been found anywhere else in the world either. It was pointed out that once these affected trees were cut down no new plants were allowed to be replanted for about the last seven years since the threat of the spread of the disease was high. During this time the CRI has ensured that the rest of the coconut plants are monitored by maintaining a radius of 3km where the disease is less prevalent. Within and outside this 3km border, areas are being monitored and as a result some areas have now been released for new replanting with a disease resistant variety. The resistant variety is produced by making a Green Dwarf coconut plant cross with a tall variety that is called CRIC 365. For the first time last year replanting commenced by the CRI. Another preventive measure adopted by the authorities was to not send the coconut plucked out of these areas outside of the region they were cultivated in a bid to control the spread of the disease to other parts of the country. Of the approximately 65 million coconut trees in the country only about 300,000 have been affected and cut down. Due to the constant monitoring carried out by the CRI the authorities in Sri Lanka have been able to control the spread of the disease to any other areas. The disease is still prevalent in these parts of the country and it continues to be monitored by the CRI.

This model encourages continuous innovation through competition, accelerates service quality improvements, and eliminates the government\u2019s need for large upfront investment, Hasith Yaggahavita, CEO of 99X, said. This will fast-track the development of digital public infrastructure and significantly strengthen the country\u2019s digital economy, Mr. Yaggahavita, CEO of 99x, told the Sunday Times Business. He said that governments are increasingly looking at innovative methods to increase the delivery of public services, and a promising approach will be developing APIs for citizen services, which allows private companies, including start-ups and university students, to create applications that utilise these API\u2019s. This will decrease public expenditure and also boost ongoing innovation and cultivate a competitive digital ecosystem, he added. He also noted that many countries, such as India, the UK, and Rhonda, have implemented such methods. \u201cA technical model can be created here where the government exposes secure API related to identity, taxes, fines, land records, postal services and utilities,\u201d he added.

He said that this rich tapestry of food would be an occasion to celebrate diversity. The suggestion came just as the government announced the Sri Lanka Day event to be held in December as a means of bridging the ethnic divide and celebrating Sri Lanka\u2019s multicultural societies. He is still waiting for a reply! That person was our young economist Ruwanputha . He called me on this Thursday morning to discuss the same topic, after reading about JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva, during a visit to London, inviting Sri Lankans to come home for the three-day festival from December 14 to 16 and celebrate the event\u2019s unity theme. \u201cI wrote to Sri Lanka Tourism many months ago to organise a food fiesta featuring the food of many communities for tourists and Sri Lankans, but sadly they didn\u2019t respond. Not even an acknowledgement of the email. This is the kind of public service that we have today. Here is an idea that they should take forward, as food is a great way to bring communities together, but sadly they didn\u2019t respond,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the problem in Sri Lanka\u2026..there is limited space in the public service for creativity and innovation. No one listens if you have a good idea. That happens only in the private sector,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe if I had proposed the idea to tourism industry associations it may have been taken on board,\u201d he said. Ruwanputha\u2019s suggestion was a simple one. December is the period when the country is filled with tourists (coming during the winter season) and also Sri Lankans resident abroad returning home for their annual year-end vacation and it is good to celebrate Sri Lanka Day with a food festival. The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said that the government was promoting Sri Lankan Day as a national platform to bring every community together. While the vision behind this event would be to create a space where all citizens can feel included and respected regardless of political, religious or cultural identity, it pointed out that it is \u201cimportant that opposition parties and civil society organisations are also included, so that the event reflects the full diversity of the country\u201d. While peace and reconciliation are considered the barometer of success of a society, one of the most forgotten aspects of culture and diversity is the colourful range of food of the different communities. Real peace and reconciliation has eluded Sri Lanka, despite efforts by many governments. One very easy aspect of bridging the ethnic divide is food and music. The diversity of food cuts across many cultural barriers. In fact in recent times, many tourists keen on learning the country\u2019s culture have visited villages and watched how food is prepared. In one step further in this process, they have also joined in the cooking, pounding ingredients in a stone mortar, preparing string hoppers and hoppers and other everyday food. Consider the rich variety of Sri Lankan food coming down the ages and influenced by our colonial masters. From the Sinhalese, you have Ambul Thiyal, a sour fish curry, Kaju Maluwa, a cashew curry, Kottu, a battered mixture of meat, vegetables and rotti made to the exciting sounds of the baila, Kiribath and Pol Sambola. From the Tamils come Appam and Indiappam (hoppers and string hoppers) from South India, Murukku, Pittu and Kiri Toffee, though some may argue that the latter is a food developed by the Sinhalese. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the food and its exquisite taste that matters, not from where it originated. The Malay community is famous for Dodol, Satay (fried beef) and Achcharu which comes from the Malay word Achar known as Malay pickle, while the Burghers celebrate their rich past with Lamprais, Rich Cake and Breudher. The small Borah community contribution is through Bombay sweets which includes Muskat. Then consider the variety of music and dances with baila, a Portuguese-origin musical song and dance form, taking pride of place. In fact, when the baila is played at family and public functions, guests let their hair down and join in the singing and dancing\u2026\u2026.communities get together and it\u2019s like time spent in the kindergarten where it didn\u2019t matter if your fellow student came from a different community. There was no class distinction or barriers on racial lines. Everyone was alike and teachers made sure everyone was treated equally. Food and music are great ways to overcome divisions and hostility among races and bring better results than speeches and special events heralding Sri Lanka\u2019s diversity. Consider a band like the Gypsies and its late, legendary leader Sunil Perera. He would have been the ideal ambassador of peace. His iconic song \u2018Piti Kotapan None\u2019 is a staple offering at many functions and weddings. Music and food indeed bring the world together and what better place than Sri Lanka where you enjoy a shot of arrack among friends with a variety of side dishes as bites. After becoming tipsy, enmity and bitterness are forgotten \u2013 we all become machans!

While these plans are still at a nascent stage, expansion outside the country is definitely on the cards in the next five to 10 years, officials said, responding to a question by The Sunday Times Business at a media event hosted by the company recently. They said that the company is quite optimistic about the current market and is geared to cater to all the segments while being bullish on opening branches and expanding island-wide. Laksanda Gunawardena, CEO of MI Finance, stated that the company has opened 43 branches over the past 18 months. \u201cBy the end of this financial year, we hope to bring our branch network to 91,\u201d he said. The plan is to move out of Colombo to more rural areas, he added.

MI Finance reported a 34 per cent rise in profit before tax to 837 million. Its lending portfolio increased from Rs. 37 billion to Rs. 75 billion, with loans comprising 35 per cent of this portfolio. Gold pawning was at 16 per cent of the loan portfolio at Rs. 12 billion as of 31st March. In an industry average of 8 per cent non-performing loan ratio, the company is maintaining a 2.8 per cent net average. Net interest income rose 24 per cent to Rs 3.4 billion, propelled by a 27 per cent increase in core book revenue and strategic repricing that lowered funding costs. The profitability surge was achieved alongside robust 40 per cent annualised growth in deposits, mobilised through the company\u2019s expanded network of 85 branches, Mr. Gunawardana added. He also noted that MI Finance is extremely positive about the Secure Transaction Registry recently launched by the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB).

While Capital Metals PLC positions the project as a world-class resource development with transformative economic potential, newly detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) findings reveal a more complex, high-stakes picture along the island\u2019s fragile eastern coastline. The project\u2019s potential and favourable economics were highlighted at a recent promotional event hosted by the Sri Lankan High Commission in London. Officials emphasised improving macroeconomic indicators, policy reforms and an upcoming Investment Protection Act aimed at strengthening investor confidence. Capital Metals\u2019 phased development strategy keeps upfront capital low. An initial US$25 million investment is expected to generate $35-40 million in annual revenue at sub-$20 million operating costs. The total project requires $80 million, and despite higher taxes and royalties introduced in Sri Lanka, updated modelling shows a strong Net Present Value of $180 million. Local partnerships are central to navigating regulatory complexities. Ambeon Capital\u2019s $4 million investment for a 20 per cent stake has strengthened the company\u2019s domestic presence. The firm currently holds the only mineral-sands mining licence in the country and awaits two further approvals-licence expansion and export clearance. With first production targeted for early 2027, Capital Metals argues that the Taprobane project represents a rare opportunity: a high-grade, low-cost, strategically located mineral asset trading at a market value well below its economic potential. The project is located on the Akkaraipattu-Komari coastal belt in the Ampara District, Eastern Province, close to the towns of Pottuvil and Akkaraipattu. This 50-300 metre-wide stretch of beach known for its rich deposits of ilmenite, rutile, zircon, garnet and sillimanite has been divided into five sections: Tampaddai, Thirukkovil, Mulliadi, Omari and Sangamankanda. The total recoverable heavy mineral content is estimated at 5.43 million tonnes, making it one of the highest-grade undeveloped deposits globally. However, the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for the proposed mining operation offers a measured warning while granting overall clearance and concluding that the project\u2019s economic benefits outweigh environmental costs. The assessment identifies significant ecological risks. Two rare plant species, five endemic species and 12 nationally threatened plants have been recorded on the sand dunes set to undergo mining. The report states that disturbing such habitats will have \u201cmajor impacts on the ecology and biodiversity of the area\u201d. Although lagoons and mangroves fall outside the direct mining zone, the EIA warns of indirect disturbances to wildlife due to dust, noise and vibration. Strict mitigatory measures, continuous monitoring and early-warning systems have been recommended to prevent long-term ecological harm.

By Bandula Sirimanna Sri Lankas most advanced mineral-sands venture, the Taprobane Minerals Project, formerly the Eastern Minerals Project, has reached a defining moment as investor interest grows, regulatory approvals near, and fresh environmental concerns emerge. While Capital Metals PLC positions the project as a world-class resource development with transformative economic potential, newly detailed Environmental Impact Assessment EIA findings reveal a more complex, high-stakes picture along the islands fragile eastern coastline. The projects potential and favourable economics were highlighted at a recent promotional event hosted by the Sri Lankan High Commission in London. Officials emphasised improving macroeconomic indicators, policy reforms and an upcoming Investment Protection Act aimed at strengthening investor confidence. Capital Metals phased development strategy keeps upfront capital low. An initial US25 million investment is expected to generate 35-40 million in annual revenue at sub-20 million operating costs. The total project requires 80 million, and despite higher taxes and royalties introduced in Sri Lanka, updated modelling shows a strong Net Present Value of 180 million. Local partnerships are central to navigating regulatory complexities. Ambeon Capitals 4 million investment for a 20 per cent stake has strengthened the companys domestic presence. The firm currently holds the only mineral-sands mining licence in the country and awaits two further approvals-licence expansion and export clearance.

While Polonnaruwa\u2019s average yield currently stands at around 4.5 metric tonnes per hectare, agricultural experts estimate the potential yield at approximately six metric tonnes. To help bridge this gap, the programme focused on creating awareness about modern cultivation methods, responsible use of agro-chemicals, mechanisation, financial management, and environmental sustainability. The bank said the initiative aims to position Polonnaruwa as a model district for sustainable, GAP-based paddy cultivation.

JXG Janashakthi Group has announced consolidated results for the first half of the financial year 2026 1H FY26, ending September 2025, demonstrating solid momentum in profitability and strong growth across key financial and operational metrics. We are pleased to see the positive trajectory continue into the first half of FY26, with performance surpassing the previous year, said Ramesh Schaffter, Managing Director Group CEO, JXG Janashakthi Group, in a media release. Net profit for 1H FY26 climbed to Rs. 3.4 billion, an improvement from the same period last year revenue for the same period was Rs. 15.8 billion, up 43.6 per cent year-on-year YoY while total assets amounted to at Rs. 193.5 billion, indicating a 19.9 per cent YoY growth. Revenue contributions from subsidiaries YTD were First Capital Holdings PLC FCH Rs. 9.3 billion Janashakthi Insurance PLC JINS Rs. 3.8 billion and Janashakthi Finance PLC JF Rs. 2.8 billion.

This move will bring a large number of small retailers into the tax net and ultimately pass the 18 per cent VAT burden onto consumers. It will also create an imbalance in the economy, as most consumers will shift their purchases toward goods and services provided by businesses that are not liable for VAT. At a time when people are already struggling with the rising cost of living, this will be yet another blow to both small enterprises and the wider population,\u201d asserted Mahendra Perera, President of the Ceylon Federation of MSME, adding that many shops and small businesses will be trapped in this financial dilemma. Speakers at the event: Mr. Mahendra Perera (left) and Mr. G. K. Sudath Kumar. Pic by M.A.Pushpa Kumara. He was speaking at the Sunday Times Business Club (STBC)\u2019s bi-monthly meeting on Tuesday which focused on the \u2018collapse of small Sri Lankan businesses\u2019 owing to the Easter Sunday attack, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. The host hotel of the meeting is Shangri-La and the sponsor of the club is NDB Bank. He said like in many other countries, the MSME sector is the backbone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. MSMEs contribute 52 per cent to the national GDP and provide employment to 4.5 million people in the workforce. Quoting 2022 data from the Department of Census and Statistics, he said out of 1.3 million MSMEs, 263,000 have permanently closed, 14,577 are temporarily closed, and approximately 1,050,000 remain active. This data represents the situation up to 2022; however, the major impacts of the economic crisis was felt most strongly in 2023\u20132024. \u201cTherefore, we believe that an additional 100,000 or more enterprises have already been affected due to the bankruptcy declaration and the sharp rise in interest rates,\u201d he added. Mr. Perera said while parate execution was temporarily suspended, the extension ended in March 2025 and now a large number of MSME assets are already in the process of being auctioned. The Parate Act, which dates back to 1990, urgently needs to be amended to reflect current economic realities. Although the present government issued two circulars in December 2024 and January 2025, these have failed to address the core issues faced by MSMEs, pointing out that even though Rs. 50 billion was allocated for the MSME sector in the 2026 Budget, more than 60 per cent of MSMEs are listed in CRIB with Non-Performing Loan (NPL) status, making access to capital finance extremely difficult. The second speaker at the event, liquidator expert G. K. Sudath Kumar, Partner \u2013 Nanayakkara & Company, detailed out the various options offered to bankrupt firms via the process of an administrator or, if that doesn\u2019t work, liquidation. He said many companies are going into liquidation, and faced with the growing number of cases, one of the commercial high courts has been set aside purely for liquidation cases. When a company is unable to pay its debt, the directors of the company seek court permission to either wind up the company or declare bankruptcy. An administrator is then appointed, as a first step, to see whether the company can be revived after speaking to all creditors and debtors on restructuring due payments and restructuring the debt. In some cases, resuscitation succeeds, in some cases it won\u2019t. It\u2019s a fine balancing act by the administrator, he pointed out adding that in the Sri Lanka case, many people don\u2019t trust an administrator and this is an issue.

What began as government policy rooted in environmental concerns has now created a widening economic gap one that industry stakeholders warn could take years to repair without urgent government intervention, industry stakeholders said Since the CPO import ban came into effect in April 2021, Sri Lanka has spent over US$175 million importing edible oils to meet domestic demand-an expense the country can ill afford amid its ongoing balance-of-payments pressures. Although a functioning oil-palm industry once supplied part of the almost-264,000 metric tonnes consumed annually domestically, the nation continues to depend nearly wholly on imports The fallout has been especially severe for Board of Investment (BOI) enterprises that relied on CPO as a key raw material for exports. These manufacturers once regular suppliers of hydrogenated palm-oil products such as vanaspathi ghee, bakery shortening, CBS fats and chocolate fats have collectively incurred losses estimated at $40 million. Their export pipelines collapsed after access to CPO was cut off in 2022, despite preferential market access under the Indo\u2013Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA). Ironically, India Sri Lanka\u2019s largest trading partner has recently reopened the same HS codes for palm-oil-based imports, while simultaneously increasing its own edible-oil tariffs. The result is a surge in demand for Sri Lankan processed palm-oil exports, but domestic producers remain paralysed without access to CPO. Industry representatives, in a detailed submission to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, have called for an immediate policy reset. They seek approval for BOI-registered companies to import CPO (HS Code 1511.10) through a tightly regulated licensing mechanism. Such a step, they argue, would restore export production, support domestic edible-oil supply chains, and generate an estimated $75 million annually in new export revenue. The appeal goes beyond short-term import relief. Plantation companies are also urging the government to lift the nationwide prohibition on new oil-palm cultivation a ban introduced in 2022 that abruptly halted a sector specifically developed to reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s edible-oil deficit. They propose a structured replanting programme of 10,000 acres annually, projecting that the country could achieve edible-oil self-sufficiency and even generate an export surplus within six years. Their argument is rooted in regional trends. India, which imports nearly eight million tonnes of palm oil annually, has already launched a massive programme to cultivate oil palm on five million hectares-a signal that palm cultivation, when regulated, is strategically valuable for food security. As Sri Lanka prepares for its 2026 shift from the Special Commodity Levy to a more predictable ad valorem tax structure for imported oils, one question lingers on: will policy reform come soon enough? The answer might mean life or death for manufacturers, plantation workers, and rural communities whose livelihoods depend on the sector.

What began as government policy rooted in environmental concerns has now created a widening economic gap one that industry stakeholders warn could take years to repair without urgent government intervention, industry stakeholders said Since the CPO import ban came into effect in April 2021, Sri Lanka has spent over US175 million importing edible oils to meet domestic demand-an expense the country can ill afford amid its ongoing balance-of-payments pressures. Although a functioning oil-palm industry once supplied part of the almost-264,000 metric tonnes consumed annually domestically, the nation continues to depend nearly wholly on imports The fallout has been especially severe for Board of Investment BOI enterprises that relied on CPO as a key raw material for exports. These manufacturers once regular suppliers of hydrogenated palm-oil products such as vanaspathi ghee, bakery shortening, CBS fats and chocolate fats have collectively incurred losses estimated at 40 million. Their export pipelines collapsed after access to CPO was cut off in 2022, despite preferential market access under the IndoSri Lanka Free Trade Agreement ISFTA. Ironically, India Sri Lankas largest trading partner has recently reopened the same HS codes for palm-oil-based imports, while simultaneously increasing its own edible-oil tariffs. The result is a surge in demand for Sri Lankan processed palm-oil exports, but domestic producers remain paralysed without access to CPO. Industry representatives, in a detailed submission to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, have called for an immediate policy reset. They seek approval for BOI-registered companies to import CPO HS Code 1511.10 through a tightly regulated licensing mechanism. Such a step, they argue, would restore export production, support domestic edible-oil supply chains, and generate an estimated 75 million annually in new export revenue. The appeal goes beyond short-term import relief. Plantation companies are also urging the government to lift the nationwide prohibition on new oil-palm cultivation a ban introduced in 2022 that abruptly halted a sector specifically developed to reduce Sri Lankas edible-oil deficit. They propose a structured replanting programme of 10,000 acres annually, projecting that the country could achieve edible-oil self-sufficiency and even generate an export surplus within six years. Their argument is rooted in regional trends. India, which imports nearly eight million tonnes of palm oil annually, has already launched a massive programme to cultivate oil palm on five million hectares-a signal that palm cultivation, when regulated, is strategically valuable for food security. As Sri Lanka prepares for its 2026 shift from the Special Commodity Levy to a more predictable ad valorem tax structure for imported oils, one question lingers on will policy reform come soon enough? The answer might mean life or death for manufacturers, plantation workers, and rural communities whose livelihoods depend on the sector.

To relegate AI to next year\u2019s agenda is to overlook its profound capacity to reshape operational paradigms, accelerate innovation, and redefine competitive advantage. Organisations can start with enterprise AI gradually, focusing on incremental use cases that drive efficiency and innovation without requiring major budgets or disruptive system changes. Yet, this promise is interwoven with nuances and intricacies that boards must navigate with discernment. The mandate is not to stifle adoption but to enable it responsibly, embedding AI within a governance architecture that harmonises ambition with accountability. AI is revolutionising how leaders and teams manage complexity, but its power must be guided responsibly. Board members can receive concise summaries of lengthy board papers before meetings, saving hours of preparation, while CEOs leverage AI to draft strategic briefs or scenario analyses in minutes. CFOs gain rapid financial insights, company secretaries can turn meeting transcripts into accurate minutes, and auditors accelerate risk reviews with AI-assisted checks. Sales teams prioritise leads, and call centre managers analyse customer sentiment instantly. These capabilities are real and accessible today, but they demand human-in-the-loop oversight, especially as organisations experiment with automated decision-making in areas like credit approvals, recruitment screening, and compliance alerts. Boards must ensure these systems remain transparent, explainable, and subject to human override to prevent bias, errors, and regulatory breaches. Achieving this balance calls for a truly cross-functional approach, aligned with the organisation\u2019s defined and regularly revisited risk appetite and tolerance levels. Boards set the strategic vision and provide oversight, while ICT and data teams build secure, scalable systems. Compliance and legal functions ensure regulations and contracts are met, risk managers anticipate and mitigate emerging threats within acceptable boundaries, and both internal and external audit update their programmes to include algorithm audits, data governance checks, bias and fairness testing, explainability reviews, cybersecurity controls, and assurance that human-in-the-loop oversight is maintained. Agile practices must also be embedded to adapt quickly to regulatory changes and emerging risks. Together, these roles create a unified governance framework that turns AI into a responsibly managed strategic asset driving innovation while staying within agreed risk parameters. AI exists across a spectrum of capability. At the foundational level is \u2018Narrow AI\u2019, systems built for a single purpose, such as Siri or Alexa handling voice commands, Netflix\u2019s recommendation engine tailoring content, or spam filters protecting email inboxes. A step further is \u2018Advanced Narrow AI\u2019, which remains domain-specific but demonstrates remarkable sophistication. Examples include ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Perplexity AI, China\u2019s ERNIE Bot, and DeepSeek. These systems can generate text, summarize documents, translate languages, assist with coding; enable computer vision for autonomous vehicles; and power scientific tools like AlphaFold for protein structure prediction. Beyond these practical applications lies \u2018General AI (AGI)\u2019, still hypothetical, which would mirror human cognitive flexibility, an AI capable of designing buildings, managing finances, and learning new skills without retraining. Some multi-modal AI systems (combining text, image, audio, and video) and agent-based architectures are moving toward AGI-like behaviour, but they remain domain-constrained. The ultimate frontier is \u2018Super AI\u2019 (ASI, with even post-ASI possibilities), a theoretical stage where machines surpass human intelligence entirely, a theoretical stage where machines surpass human intelligence entirely, innovating and governing at scales beyond human comprehension. While AGI and ASI remain aspirational, Narrow and Advanced Narrow AI are already transforming corporate operations, regulatory compliance, and government service delivery, bringing both unprecedented opportunities and governance challenges that demand immediate board-level attention. The EU AI Act, along with emerging national laws, OECD principles, and country-level AI strategies, is shaping a global regulatory landscape for responsible AI adoption. Together, these frameworks create a compliance environment that demands proactive data governance, AI inventorying, risk classification, vendor oversight, explainability, and robust accountability processes well before fully automated systems are deployed.

Speaking to The Daily Morning , the Ministry Secretary Nalaka Kaluwawa said that the idea of a regulatory mechanism for private schools and universities has come up repeatedly, but that at present, there is no legal or administrative structure in place to enforce standards or monitor operations. He explained that this gap is primarily due to policy limitations, as the Ministry does not have the authority to impose regulations without a national-level framework approved by the Government.  \"The NEC has now been tasked with drafting the relevant policy, which will cover private schools as well as private universities. They are currently working on it,\u201d he said, adding that the recommendations will guide the Government in deciding how oversight should be implemented.  He also pointed out that any attempt to regulate private school and university fees or introduce uniform standards would however require a separate mechanism, particularly because private and international schools fall into a wide range of categories based on facilities, curricula, and operational models.  Sri Lanka\u2019s education system is divided into the large, State-run public sector and a growing private sector, which includes international schools, semi-international schools, and private higher education institutions. Although public schools operate under Government-imposed regulations, a central curriculum, and oversight mechanisms, the private sector functions with far more flexibility. However, the rapid expansion of private education has sparked calls for stronger oversight. Issues such as varying academic standards, wide differences in fees, inconsistent teacher qualifications, and limited consumer protection for parents have highlighted the need for a structured regulatory system. Meanwhile, the Ministry has announced that this year\u2019s (2025) General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (A/L) Examination will resume on 12 January of next year (2026). The Exam was suspended owing to the recent landslides and flooding across the country following Cyclone Ditwah \u2019s landfall last month (November). The Ministry has also decided to reopen 9,926 schools on 16 December. All schools in the Western, Southern, Northern, Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and North-Central Provinces will reopen for academic activities on 16 December, Kaluwewa has announced. The Ceylon Teachers\u2019 Union (CTU) has urged the Government to introduce an immediate concessional relief programme for teachers and principals affected by the recent disaster situation. The CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin stated that a significant number of teachers and principals have been severely impacted and are struggling with existing financial burdens, including outstanding loans. He noted that Kaluwewa has confirmed that nearly 100,000 individuals have been affected, and that a decision has been taken to provide Rs. 25,000 to affected children.\u00a0He also mentioned that the Suraksha insurance scheme is currently in operation and can be used to support the needs of students, although clarity regarding the specific benefits available to them has not yet been provided. Commenting further, Stalin emphasised the urgent need for financial relief for affected educators: \u201cMany of the affected teachers and principals are burdened with existing loans. Therefore, a concessional relief arrangement must be introduced for these loans. The Government should intervene and, at the very least, consider cancelling them.\u201d    The Morning is Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost national news brand, delivering timely insights across politics, current affairs, sport, and entertainment.

President Dissanayake has also instructed all officials and the relevant sectors to complete necessary repairs before 31 December, by utilising the allocations given by the Government for infrastructure development and not to return any part of the allocations under any circumstances. The President said that there is no shortage of funds required for the provision of relief to the people and for restoring normal life and that what is necessary in this emergency situation is for all institutions to fulfil their responsibilities through proper coordination without limitations. President Dissanayake made these remarks while participating at the District Coordinating Committee meeting held at the Uva Province Library to review the programme being carried out to restore normalcy to the lives of the affected people in the Badulla District and to develop essential infrastructure. Due to the disaster situation, 64,140 individuals belonging to 19,133 families in the District have been affected. A total of 418 houses have been destroyed while 7,703 houses have been partially damaged. President Dissanayake pointed out the need to carry out all road repairs simultaneously without dividing them as roads under the Road Development Authority (RDA), Provincial roads, or Local Government (LG) authority roads. He informed officials that if the funds allocated for this purpose are insufficient, they should request the required additional allocations. The President also instructed that an estimate be prepared and submitted for all roads in the District requiring permanent repairs and noted that funds can be provided to commence this work by January of next year (2026). The officials stated that 90% of the District\u2019s damaged electricity supply due to the disaster situation has already been restored and that the remaining supply is also being restored swiftly. They further pointed out that steps have been taken to ensure that the District\u2019s water supply is provided as required. The President instructed the Government\u2019s allowance of Rs. 15,000 granted to affected schoolchildren be paid promptly through the intervention of the Divisional Secretaries. Due to the disaster situation, 6,711 acres of agricultural land in the District have been damaged. The President instructed that the relevant farmers and the extent of damaged land be identified, compensation be provided swiftly and they be directed back into cultivation. He further instructed officials of the Irrigation Department to provide water to agricultural lands at least temporarily, so that the farmers will be able to cultivate the Maha season. The President stated that the allowance of Rs. 25,000 provided for the cleansing and restoration of damaged temples and religious sites will be granted through the Cultural Affairs Department and that a Cabinet of Ministers decision regarding this matter is expected this week. The President also highlighted the need to implement programmes aimed at improving the mental health of the people living in camps. President Dissanayake has expressed his gratitude to United States (US) President Donald Trump for standing with Sri Lanka yet again at a time of need. The US pledged Dollars ($) two million to assist urgent relief efforts in Sri Lanka, following the severe impact of Cyclone Ditwah, which caused heavy rains and flooding across many areas. The US also deployed two C-130J Super Hercules aircraft to support ongoing relief efforts. President Dissanayake said that the swift deployment of the C-130 aircraft and $ 2 million emergency assistance reflect the strength of the enduring partnership between the two countries, firmly rooted in shared democratic values and close ties between our people.

Meanwhile, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) reports that about 15,000 landslide-prone locations have been identified across the country, and that nearly 5,000 families residing in those high-risk areas have already been relocated. Senior Scientist at the NBRO, Dr. Wasantha Senadheera stated that residents living in the identified risk zones must evacuate without delay for their safety. Dr. Senadheera further explained that incidents reported to the NBRO are studied based on a priority list received through a channel starting with the Grama Niladhari officer, progressing through the Divisional Secretary, and finally to the District Secretary. The NBRO announced that the red evacuation notices issued to 41 Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) in four Districts at 4 p.m. on Monday (08) will remain in effect. In addition, notices under Stage Two have been issued to 31 DSDs in five Districts, while Phase One notices have been issued for 19 DSDs in four other Districts, Dr. Senadheera said. The DMC has instructed District Secretaries to evacuate people living in landslide-prone areas in the Districts of Kandy, Kegalle, Kurunegala, and Matale to designated safe centres. The evacuation warning has been issued in line with the Level Three (Red) landslide warnings issued by the NBRO due to the ongoing adverse weather conditions. The NBRO has identified multiple high-risk locations across the four Districts, prompting the need for immediate precautionary action. Accordingly, the DMC has directed District Secretaries to relocate residents in the affected areas to safe centres from yesterday (09) and till 19 December of this year (2025). The DMC further noted that evacuation operations will be coordinated with the District Secretaries, NBRO officials, DSs, Grama Niladharis, the Police, and the other relevant authorities. The Districts and DSDs under Level Three (Red) landslide warnings are as follows: the Kandy District \u2013 Hatharaliyadda, Yatinuwara, Udadumbara, Pathahewaheta, Medadumbara, Pasbage Korale, Deltota, Poojapitiya, Ganga Ihala Korale, Panwila, Gangawata Korale, Udapalatha, Harispattuwa, Kundasale, Minipe, Doluwa, Thumpane, Akurana, Udunuwara, Pathadumbara and the surrounding areas, the Kegalle District - Kegalle, Galigamuwa, Mawanella, Bulathkohupitiya, Aranayaka, Yatiyanthota, Rambukkana, Warakapola and the surrounding areas, the Kurunegala District - Mawathagama, Mallawapitiya, Rideegama and the surrounding areas, and the Matale District \u2013 Naula, Wilgamuwa, Pallepola, Ambanganga Korale, Laggala Pallegama, Ukuwela, Rattota, Matale, Yatawatta and the surrounding areas. The Deputy Director of Weather Forecasting and Disaster Management at the Meteorology Department, Meril Mendis noted that rainy (showers or thundershowers) conditions may continue until 19 December, especially in the Northern, North-Central, Eastern, Central, North-Western and Uva Provinces. The North-East monsoon conditions have established over the island. Fairly heavy falls above 75 millimetres (mm) are likely at some places in the Northern and North-Central Provinces and in the Trincomalee District. Showers or thundershowers may occur at several places in the other areas of the island after 1 p.m. today (10). Fairly heavy falls above 50 mm are likely at some places in these areas. Fairly strong winds of about 30-40 kilometres per hour can be expected at times over the Northern, North Central and North-Western Provinces and in the Trincomalee District and the Eastern slopes of the Central Hills. The general public has also been requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by temporary localised strong winds and lightning during thunderstorms. With the North-East monsoon expected to continue to some extent in the coming days, Dr. Senadheera urged residents in high-risk areas to exercise heightened caution, remain in safe locations, and avoid unnecessary travel, as the failure to do so could pose a life-threatening risk. Elsewhere, the Irrigation Department reports that water levels in several major reservoirs across the country are being further reduced in response to rainfall forecasts for the coming days. The Director of Irrigation (Hydrology and Disaster Management), L.S. Sooriyabandara stated that water is currently being released to lower reservoir levels in Nachchaduwa and Rajanganaya in the Anuradhapura District; the Deduru Oya, Lunugamwehera, and Weheragala in the Hambantota District; and the Senanayake Samudraya in the Ampara District. A sluice gate of the Upper Kotmale Reservoir has been opened due to rains in catchment areas.

New geospatial analysis from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) shows that floodwaters from the cyclone inundated more than 1.1 million hectares \u2013 almost 20 per cent of the country\u2019s land area \u2013 and caused significant damage to homes, infrastructure and essential services. The analysis draws from disaster related data from the Sri Lankan Government. Over half of the people in the flooded areas were living in households already facing multiple vulnerabilities before the cyclone, including an unstable income, high debt, and a limited ability to cope with disasters. Under these conditions, even moderate shocks can turn into long-lasting setbacks. The floodwaters reached nearly 720,000 buildings, about one in every 12 buildings in the country. Over 16,000 kilometres (km) of roads, enough to circle the island\u2019s coastline more than 12 times, were exposed to flooding. Similarly, over 278 km of railway tracks and 480 bridges were located in flooded areas. \u201cCyclone Ditwah struck regions already weakened by years of economic stress,\u201d said the UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka, Azusa Kubota. The exposed population includes approximately 1.2 million women, 522,000 children and 263,000 older persons, with over 60% of all exposed people living in just two Districts (Colombo and Gampaha). Many in the affected areas across the country live in high-risk, disaster-prone areas, requiring a permanent solution. This concentration of exposure is placing heavy pressure on essential services. \u201cWhere high flooding and high vulnerability overlap, recovery is likely to be slower and more costly. Early action in these locations is critical,\u201d Kubota said. In the country\u2019s hilly inland, the cyclone triggered around 1,200 landslides. These events can isolate at-risk communities by disrupting access to essential services such as healthcare and slowing rescue operations. \u201cCyclone Ditwah is a stark reminder of how fast compounding crises can unfold,\u201d said the Chief of Crisis Readiness, Response, and Recovery at the UNDP\u2019s Crisis Bureau, Devanand Ramiah. Working closely with the national authorities and partners, UNDP is calling for scaled-up early recovery support to help communities get back on their feet. This includes restoring essential services, supporting affected households, particularly women, children, and older persons, repairing key transport and service-delivery infrastructure, and strengthening local systems for future climate resilience. \u201cAfter one of its worst economic crises and a slow but steady recovery underway, Sri Lanka cannot shoulder more debt to cover the costs of a rebuild from this massive natural disaster,\u201d said Kubota. \u201cInternational partners must step up with affordable financing and innovative instruments that enable rapid recovery and rebuilding with greater resilience, without the country falling off the debt cliff. The UNDP, with the UN family, is working with the Government, our partners and communities, to support those most affected through immediate relief and early recovery efforts. The \u2018rebuild stronger and better\u2019 is essential and will take time.\u201d The UN has allocated United States Dollars ($) 4.5 million (Rs. 1.38 billion) from the Central Emergency Response Fund for communities affected by Ditwah and to strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s response to Ditwah , which made landfall on 28 November.\u00a0The funds will enable the UN to rapidly scale up emergency food assistance, shelter support, and water, sanitation and hygiene services for the communities most severely affected by the floods and landslides that have impacted the country.\u00a0Communities across Sri Lanka are continuing to grapple with the widespread impacts of the cyclone, with thousands of families still displaced after extensive damage to housing and infrastructure.\u00a0Even as response efforts are underway, latest assessments indicate that the effects of the cyclone are broader and more severe than initially understood, leaving many communities in urgent need of sustained support to fully recover from Ditwa h.\u00a0\u201cThis funding comes at a critical moment for Sri Lanka,\u201d said the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka, Marc-Andre Franche. \u201c Ditwah has upended lives across the country, and many families are still struggling to meet their basic daily needs. We are working closely with the Government, civil society partners and the humanitarian community in Sri Lanka to ensure a coordinated response guided by evidence and priority needs. This emergency funding will help us reach those most severely affected with the support that they urgently need.\u201d\u00a0 As the full scale of the devastation becomes clearer, the UN will expand its life-saving assistance to the hardest-hit communities through a broader Humanitarian Priorities Plan, expected to be announced this week.

The clash occurred on 07 December of this year (2025), leading to injuries to the said Prison Superintendent. Following the altercation, several prisoners from Boossa have been temporarily remanded at the Angunakolapelessa Prison and are set to face legal action regarding the injury. Committee President, attorney Senaka Perera, speaking to The Daily Morning , explained the sequence of events. He claimed that high-profile criminals are housed in the \u2018A\u2019 Section of Boossa, while prisoners convicted of minor crimes are in the \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019 sections. According to Perera, because the CCTV cameras in Section \u2018A\u2019 stopped operating, those inmates were forced to move to the \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019 Sections, which is where the situation occurred. Perera further raised concerns about the broader treatment of prisoners. He alleged that basic needs are not being addressed, citing arbitrary decisions by prison superintendents over what outside foods inmates can receive, despite a clear list of prohibited items. He also claimed that the authorities were purposefully delaying designated meal times. Drawing on past tragedies, Perera expressed a grave fear that the current situation could escalate. He referenced the 2012 Welikada Prison riots, where 27 prisoners died, and the 2020 Mahara Prison riot, where 11 died, incidents investigated by commissions but which, he claimed, were not addressed by the Governments. The Committee urged the Government to immediately intervene and mediate solutions to prevent further unrest in the prison system.

The Army\u2019s Engineer Task Force (ETF) has begun the retrieval and de-launching of the damaged Puliyampokkanai Bridge in Jaffna, using a wheeled excavator to support the Road Development Authority (RDA).\u00a0The task is expected to be completed by today (10), with the first Bailey bridge likely to be launched by 13 December afternoon. To aid the construction of a 120-ft dual carriageway in Jaffna, around 70 per cent of the required stores have already been moved from the RDA yard, with the rest expected to arrive by this evening. At Chilaw, pier construction is likely to begin within the next 48 hours. One complete Bailey bridge set has already reached the site, while the loading of a fourth set at Pathankot was underway and scheduled to depart at 9 a.m. yesterday (09). The ETF is using indigenous drones, SONAR-based laser range finders, remotely operated combat cruiser unmanned ground vehicles and other advanced equipment for reconnaissance at both sites, helping compress operational timelines. The PARA Field Hospital continues to deliver critical medical support, having treated 3,338 patients so far. On Monday (08), the team attended to 1,128 patients, carried out 73 minor procedures and conducted four surgeries. The Indian Navy has deployed four more warships to support relief efforts in cyclone-hit regions. The deployment includes the Indian Naval Service (INS) Gharial and three Landing Craft Utility (LCU) vessels \u2014 LCU 54, LCU 51, and LCU 57 \u2014 tasked with delivering nearly 1,000 tons of essential relief supplies to affected coastal areas. The three LCUs have reached Colombo and the critical humanitarian material has been handed to the Sri Lankan authorities. The INS Gharial docked at Trincomalee on Monday. A MI-17 helicopter provided by the Indian Government arrived at the Sri Lanka Air Force Base in Katunayake at 11.50 a.m. yesterday, following the return of two previously deployed MI-17 helicopters to India for essential maintenance. The two helicopters that were sent back had collectively rescued 270 Sri Lankans affected by the floods caused by Ditwah. The two helicopters had also transported approximately 50 metric tonnes (MT) of relief goods to distribution centres assisting communities impacted by the disaster. The helicopter which arrived yesterday was accompanied by a 14-member Indian Air Force team and is expected to join in ongoing relief operations.  Meanwhile, Pakistan has dispatched an additional 7.5 tons of humanitarian aid following widespread destruction caused by Ditwah . The additional relief consignment, including tents, tarpaulins and powdered milk, has been flown to Colombo from Lahore on a commercial aircraft. The National Disaster Management Authority has coordinated with airlines to ensure that all available cargo space on commercial flights is fully utilised for the rapid transport of relief items. This mechanism will continue in the coming days to dispatch further assistance as required. A Pakistan Army search-and-rescue team is currently operating in the affected regions, backed by Pakistan Navy ships and helicopters assisting the local authorities with evacuations and life-saving missions. Elsewhere, the World Food Programme (WFP), in partnership with the Australian Government, has dispatched a consignment of 20 MT of high-energy fortified biscuits to support communities affected by Ditwah. The emergency food aid, which arrived in Colombo, has been provided free of charge to the Sri Lankan Government under its Cyclone Emergency Response Programme. The shipment was mobilised through the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and consigned to the WFP Country Office in Colombo for distribution in coordination with the Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment Ministry. Fortified biscuits play a critical role in humanitarian crises. These high-energy, ready-to-eat products are enriched with essential vitamins and minerals, providing immediate nutritional support, especially to displaced populations with limited access to cooking facilities or food supplies. Based on a situation report shared by the Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Ministry, the WFP has recommended a targeted distribution strategy prioritising Districts where access remains severely restricted. Accordingly, the consignment will be allocated to cyclone-affected communities in Badulla, Kandy, Kegalle and Nuwara Eliya.

One complete Bailey bridge set has already reached the site, while the loading of a fourth set at Pathankot was underway and scheduled to depart at 9 a.m. yesterday 09. The ETF is using indigenous drones, SONAR-based laser range finders, remotely operated combat cruiser unmanned ground vehicles and other advanced equipment for reconnaissance at both sites, helping compress operational timelines. The PARA Field Hospital continues to deliver critical medical support, having treated 3,338 patients so far. On Monday 08, the team attended to 1,128 patients, carried out 73 minor procedures and conducted four surgeries. The Indian Navy has deployed four more warships to support relief efforts in cyclone-hit regions. The deployment includes the Indian Naval Service INS Gharial and three Landing Craft Utility LCU vessels  LCU 54, LCU 51, and LCU 57  tasked with delivering nearly 1,000 tons of essential relief supplies to affected coastal areas. The three LCUs have reached Colombo and the critical humanitarian material has been handed to the Sri Lankan authorities. The INS Gharial docked at Trincomalee on Monday. A MI-17 helicopter provided by the Indian Government arrived at the Sri Lanka Air Force Base in Katunayake at 11.50 a.m. yesterday, following the return of two previously deployed MI-17 helicopters to India for essential maintenance. The two helicopters that were sent back had collectively rescued 270 Sri Lankans affected by the floods caused by Ditwah. The two helicopters had also transported approximately 50 metric tonnes MT of relief goods to distribution centres assisting communities impacted by the disaster. The helicopter which arrived yesterday was accompanied by a 14-member Indian Air Force team and is expected to join in ongoing relief operations. Meanwhile, Pakistan has dispatched an additional 7.5 tons of humanitarian aid following widespread destruction caused by Ditwah . The additional relief consignment, including tents, tarpaulins and powdered milk, has been flown to Colombo from Lahore on a commercial aircraft. The National Disaster Management Authority has coordinated with airlines to ensure that all available cargo space on commercial flights is fully utilised for the rapid transport of relief items. This mechanism will continue in the coming days to dispatch further assistance as required. A Pakistan Army search-and-rescue team is currently operating in the affected regions, backed by Pakistan Navy ships and helicopters assisting the local authorities with evacuations and life-saving missions. Elsewhere, the World Food Programme WFP, in partnership with the Australian Government, has dispatched a consignment of 20 MT of high-energy fortified biscuits to support communities affected by Ditwah. The emergency food aid, which arrived in Colombo, has been provided free of charge to the Sri Lankan Government under its Cyclone Emergency Response Programme. The shipment was mobilised through the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and consigned to the WFP Country Office in Colombo for distribution in coordination with the Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment Ministry. Fortified biscuits play a critical role in humanitarian crises. These high-energy, ready-to-eat products are enriched with essential vitamins and minerals, providing immediate nutritional support, especially to displaced populations with limited access to cooking facilities or food supplies. Based on a situation report shared by the Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism Ministry, the WFP has recommended a targeted distribution strategy prioritising Districts where access remains severely restricted. Accordingly, the consignment will be allocated to cyclone-affected communities in Badulla, Kandy, Kegalle and Nuwara Eliya.

Speaking during a panel discussion at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce last week, Aluwihare outlined the project\u2019s evolution, highlighting China Harbour Engineering Company\u2019s (CHEC) three-decade presence in the country and the shift from engineering contracting into long-term urban development. \u201cOur journey is similar to Axiata\u2019s, CHEC has been in this country for 30 years. Initially we were doing roads, bridges and ports. With Port City, we really migrated up the value chain to become a developer,\u201d he said. He noted that the original concept was a large-scale reclaimed land project intended as a premium waterfront real estate development. However, during reclamation, the Government and project company decided to reposition it as Sri Lanka\u2019s long-missing services export zone. \u201cAs many of you know, close to 60% of Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP is services. But we still did not have a dedicated services export zone. Therefore, the idea was conceived that the Port City can be a special economic zone for export of services,\u201d Aluwihare said. He said CHEC has invested $ 1.3 billion to date in reclamation and infrastructure, with a further $ 250 million planned for phase two. \u201cWhat I would like to say is that we are now ready for business,\u201d he added. According to Aluwihare, Port City Colombo has already secured investors for six plots of land, with a total committed value of around $ 1.3 billion. Discussions are underway with about six more potential investors, and he expects these to translate into an additional $ 600\u2013850 million over the next three to four years, depending on macroeconomic stability. \u201cAs a company that has been in the country for 30 years, we are very optimistic about the potential. When we sell the Sri Lankan story overseas, what we are really trying to sell is potential. And in that story, what we try to address is the risk,\u201d he said. Aluwihare said that attracting investors requires incentives that compensate for Sri Lanka\u2019s weaker competitiveness rankings. \u201cThere are varying counterviews about providing tax holidays, especially under an IMF program tax holidays are considered taboo. But the question is, when other doing-business indicators are not competitive, what incentives do we need to attract investors?\u201d he asked. He confirmed that Port City successfully negotiated a fiscal package with the Government and the IMF, including a 10\u201315-year corporate income tax holiday, duty-free importation during project construction and exemptions from border taxes. \u201cThese should result in savings of about 20\u201325% in construction costs. Once operations start, investors will have a 10- to 15-year tax holiday,\u201d he said. However, he emphasised that the most important incentives are non-fiscal those designed to reduce foreign investor risk, particularly currency exposure. \u201cThe largest risk is foreign currency risk, especially in real estate development. Within Port City, the Sri Lankan rupee is not legal tender. It\u2019s a complete hedge against currency risk. There are 16 designated currencies you can invest and transact in,\u201d Aluwihare said. He added that Port City provides full capital mobility, a major deviation from South Asia\u2019s typically tight capital controls. \u201cSome of these restrictive capital controls that apply in the rest of South Asia do not apply in Port City,\u201d he noted, adding that companies can employ 100% foreign staff, who are eligible for long-term visas. He affirmed a single-window investment facilitation system is also in place to streamline approvals. Aluwihare acknowledged that early-stage implementation challenges persist. \u201cThere are certain initial teething problems, but these are currently being fixed. As we speak, we have 155 companies operating under Port City licences outside Port City, until the infrastructure is ready, and the total utilised space is close to 500,000 square feet,\u201d he added He added that the project\u2019s early traction has also given \u201ca much-needed boost to the real estate sector in Colombo,\u201d signalling rising investor confidence as the special economic zone approaches full operational readiness.

Speaking at a panel discussion at the \u2018Investment Pulse \u2013 Why Sri Lanka: Investor View\u2019 session of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, he said they, however, remain on track for next year\u2019s target of $ 20 billion. Over the past 10 months, total exports in both merchandise and services exports amounted to $ 14.4 billion, reflecting a 6% growth rate, which the EDB Chief described as a significant uptick compared with the past decade and signalling a positive trend despite structural vulnerabilities. He noted that the EDB has set out an ambitious agenda to reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s longstanding dependence on traditional commodities and apparel, aiming to raise the export sector\u2019s share of GDP from roughly 19% to 25% by 2030. \u201cTo reach the $ 36 billion target, comprising $ 28 billion from merchandise and over $ 8 billion from services, Sri Lanka must sustain annual export growth of 10-12% from 2026 onwards,\u201d he said. Wijesinghe accepted the challenge of moving beyond Sri Lanka\u2019s traditional sectors, stressing that product and value-chain diversification must be paired with market diversification and structural reform. He said the Government\u2019s strategy, embodied in a soon-to-be-published National Export Development Plan (NEDP) for 2026\u20132030, aims for total export receipts of about $ 36 billion by the end of the four years, driven by faster growth in both merchandise and services exports. \u201cThe finalised NEDP will be presented in January 2026 and will provide the roadmap for translating targets into investment, skills development, and new-market penetration. If implemented, the combination of tariff reform, digital trade facilitation, renewed trade diplomacy, and focused sector development could substantially de-risk the economy and put exports on a higher-growth trajectory,\u201d he explained. According to him, the plan, which the EDB has prepared in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and after months of stakeholder consultations, rests on three pillars; boosting trade competitiveness, expanding regional and global market linkages, and promoting sustainable, trade-led growth. To change the composition of the export basket, he said the EDB has identified priority sectors beyond apparel, coconut, rubber, and tea, which together still comprise an estimated 60% of current export value. He identified several \u201ctier one\u201d sectors earmarked for rapid expansion, including ICT/BPM, which is expected to surpass $ 1.7 billion this year and grow to over $ 5 billion by 2030, as well as logistics, electronics and electrical manufacturing, food and beverages, spices, and gems and jewellery. \u201cLogistics alone, currently generating around $ 1.7 billion, is projected to grow by 15-20% annually given Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic geographic position. In addition, we have identified mineral-based exports as a high-potential tier-two sector that remains significantly underutilised,\u201d he added. He said market diversification will also be key to the strategy. \u201cThe US still remains the single largest market, accounting for nearly 25% of Sri Lanka\u2019s export earnings, and Europe contributes about 22%. The EDB is pushing for deeper penetration into African, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets. Exports to these regions have grown by over 25% during the January-October period, underscoring their potential,\u201d he pointed out. The EDB Chief also noted that economic diplomacy has been strengthened, with foreign missions now assigned export performance targets. \u201cTo capitalise on this momentum, the EDB plans to strengthen economic diplomacy and has set performance targets for Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign missions. We are also pushing a formal review of existing free trade agreements (FTAs) and preferential trade arrangements (PTAs) and are proposing negotiations on new FTAs and PTAs to support the $ 36 billion objective,\u201d he said. He noted that a Ministerial Committee, chaired by Trade, Commerce and Food Security Ministry Secretary K.A. Vimalenthirarajah, has been constituted to evaluate current agreements and will report early next year. Wijesinghe highlighted significant policy reforms included in the 2026 Budget, particularly efforts to modernise the country\u2019s outdated tariff structure to create a transparent and investor-friendly environment. \u201cThe long-discussed National Single Window has finally secured Rs. 2.5 billion in funding to move forward, enabling full online integration of key agencies including the Board of Investment (BOI), EDB, Customs, and the Land Ministry to streamline trade processes and shift to e-invoicing,\u201d he said. The EDB Chief also stated the reactivation of the Export Development Council of Ministers (EDCM), chaired by the President and revived after nearly 20 years, as a significant governance step. \u201cThe EDCM will play a key role in policy coordination, especially in light of the reconstruction needs following recent disasters. The Council, exporter forums, and sectoral task forces will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NEDP and ensuring that reforms remain aligned with national priorities,\u201d he added. He said the new strategy reflects a decisive shift in Sri Lanka\u2019s export ambitions, balancing diversification, market expansion, and policy modernisation to reduce economic risk and accelerate growth. \u201cThe goal is not only to boost revenue, but to transform the export sector into a more resilient and technologically advanced engine of the economy,\u201d Wijesinghe pointed out.

Over the past 10 months, total exports in both merchandise and services exports amounted to  14.4 billion, reflecting a 6 growth rate, which the EDB Chief described as a significant uptick compared with the past decade and signalling a positive trend despite structural vulnerabilities. He noted that the EDB has set out an ambitious agenda to reduce Sri Lankas longstanding dependence on traditional commodities and apparel, aiming to raise the export sectors share of GDP from roughly 19 to 25 by 2030. To reach the  36 billion target, comprising  28 billion from merchandise and over  8 billion from services, Sri Lanka must sustain annual export growth of 10-12 from 2026 onwards, he said. Wijesinghe accepted the challenge of moving beyond Sri Lankas traditional sectors, stressing that product and value-chain diversification must be paired with market diversification and structural reform. He said the Governments strategy, embodied in a soon-to-be-published National Export Development Plan NEDP for 20262030, aims for total export receipts of about  36 billion by the end of the four years, driven by faster growth in both merchandise and services exports. The finalised NEDP will be presented in January 2026 and will provide the roadmap for translating targets into investment, skills development, and new-market penetration. If implemented, the combination of tariff reform, digital trade facilitation, renewed trade diplomacy, and focused sector development could substantially de-risk the economy and put exports on a higher-growth trajectory, he explained. According to him, the plan, which the EDB has prepared in partnership with the Asian Development Bank ADB and after months of stakeholder consultations, rests on three pillars boosting trade competitiveness, expanding regional and global market linkages, and promoting sustainable, trade-led growth. To change the composition of the export basket, he said the EDB has identified priority sectors beyond apparel, coconut, rubber, and tea, which together still comprise an estimated 60 of current export value. He identified several tier one sectors earmarked for rapid expansion, including ICTBPM, which is expected to surpass  1.7 billion this year and grow to over  5 billion by 2030, as well as logistics, electronics and electrical manufacturing, food and beverages, spices, and gems and jewellery. Logistics alone, currently generating around  1.7 billion, is projected to grow by 15-20 annually given Sri Lankas strategic geographic position. In addition, we have identified mineral-based exports as a high-potential tier-two sector that remains significantly underutilised, he added. He said market diversification will also be key to the strategy. The US still remains the single largest market, accounting for nearly 25 of Sri Lankas export earnings, and Europe contributes about 22. The EDB is pushing for deeper penetration into African, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets. Exports to these regions have grown by over 25 during the January-October period, underscoring their potential, he pointed out. The EDB Chief also noted that economic diplomacy has been strengthened, with foreign missions now assigned export performance targets. To capitalise on this momentum, the EDB plans to strengthen economic diplomacy and has set performance targets for Sri Lankas foreign missions. We are also pushing a formal review of existing free trade agreements FTAs and preferential trade arrangements PTAs and are proposing negotiations on new FTAs and PTAs to support the  36 billion objective, he said. He noted that a Ministerial Committee, chaired by Trade, Commerce and Food Security Ministry Secretary K.A. Vimalenthirarajah, has been constituted to evaluate current agreements and will report early next year. Wijesinghe highlighted significant policy reforms included in the 2026 Budget, particularly efforts to modernise the countrys outdated tariff structure to create a transparent and investor-friendly environment. The long-discussed National Single Window has finally secured Rs. 2.5 billion in funding to move forward, enabling full online integration of key agencies including the Board of Investment BOI, EDB, Customs, and the Land Ministry to streamline trade processes and shift to e-invoicing, he said. The EDB Chief also stated the reactivation of the Export Development Council of Ministers EDCM, chaired by the President and revived after nearly 20 years, as a significant governance step. The EDCM will play a key role in policy coordination, especially in light of the reconstruction needs following recent disasters. The Council, exporter forums, and sectoral task forces will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NEDP and ensuring that reforms remain aligned with national priorities, he added. He said the new strategy reflects a decisive shift in Sri Lankas export ambitions, balancing diversification, market expansion, and policy modernisation to reduce economic risk and accelerate growth. The goal is not only to boost revenue, but to transform the export sector into a more resilient and technologically advanced engine of the economy, Wijesinghe pointed out.

Kidd, who leads operations for the world\u2019s largest adventure travel company across over 120 destinations, said Sri Lanka already possesses \u201cremarkable natural, cultural and human advantages\u201d that are driving rapid growth for Intrepid. Delivering the keynote during the \u2018Tourism - How can we finally market Sri Lanka as a tourist destination?\u2019 session of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce last week, she noted that Sri Lanka broke into the company\u2019s global top 10 destinations for the first time in 2024, with arrivals doubling that year and growing a further 50% each in 2025 and 2026. \u201cSri Lanka has a diversity of attractions; beautiful landscapes, rich culture and iconic biodiversity and most importantly, warm and welcoming people. With peace and stability, Sri Lanka has much to offer. But now is the time to determine what future Sri Lanka wants for tourism and to learn from examples around the world,\u201d she said. Kidd stressed that tourism\u2019s global footprint makes responsible practices essential. With one in 10 workers worldwide earning a livelihood from tourism, she said the industry, when well-managed, can preserve heritage, conserve biodiversity, distribute wealth and foster \u201cpeople-to-people diplomacy\u201d in an increasingly polarised world. But she warned that these benefits \u201cdo not just happen\u201d and can be quickly reversed when volumes exceed capacity. Citing global data, she noted that tourism accounts for over 10% of global carbon emissions, while rising anti-tourism protests from Europe to Japan and Indonesia are a reminder of the consequences of unmanaged visitor flows, disrespectful behaviour and infrastructure being diverted away from local needs. \u201cThese are warning signs that Sri Lanka must learn from,\u201d she said, adding that strategic tourism planning and destination management are needed to determine appropriate carrying capacities, prioritise quality over unchecked volume and ensure both economic and experiential value. She said Sri Lanka\u2019s wide product diversity; beaches, culture, wildlife, outdoor adventure and wellness should be seen as a competitive strength, not a branding dilemma. The variety \u201chas something for everyone,\u201d she said, noting that it enables year-round offerings, geographic dispersal and higher-value segments such as food tourism, family travel and premium experiences. Emerging global travel trends, she said, further strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s position. \u201cSafety and security remain the top consideration, affordability is second, and the third is sustainability,\u201d she explained, citing Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) data showing travellers are actively avoiding overcrowded destinations and preferring shoulder seasons, alternative cities and authentic cultural experiences. She said Intrepid\u2019s own research shows that 74% of its customers want meaningful community connections, something Sri Lanka can offer effortlessly. However, Kidd cautioned that sustainability expectations are now shaping competitiveness. She pointed to data from Europe showing that a third of travellers may change destinations if sustainability standards are lacking. Countries like T\u00fcrkey and Singapore have adopted Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) criteria nationally, while investors increasingly require sustainability credentials to unlock grants, concessional financing and technical support. She stressed that protecting Sri Lanka\u2019s natural and cultural assets, its biodiversity, heritage sites and local traditions must be \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d. \u201cIf these are degraded, the industry will suffer long term,\u201d she warned, raising concerns about waste, water management, ethical wildlife tourism and the strain on historic sites. \u201cIf the answer to any of these questions is no, it will impact the experience of travellers and the reputation of the destination,\u201d she pointed out. Kidd also highlighted the need for greater community inclusion, particularly for women who make most global travel decisions yet occupy less than 10% of visible industry roles in Sri Lanka, and only about 3% of guiding positions. \u201cWomen have incredible stories to tell,\u201d she said, noting that tourism involvement expands economic benefits across families and communities. She said Intrepid has used partnerships to model how sustainability, community empowerment and tourism growth can reinforce each other. Through the Intrepid Foundation, the company works with Zero Plastic Movement to tackle waste and advocate regulatory reform. It also integrates electric vehicles into its supply chain to reduce emissions and partners with the Market Development Facility (MDF) Australia on women-focused training programs. \u201cThese are examples of how we strive to create positive change through the joy of travel and sustain the destinations that are so important to us,\u201d she said. Kidd said to a top panel which featured Sri Lanka Tourism Chairman Buddhika Hewawasam that the time is here to \u201cnot only plan for the future, but start implementing practical steps.\u201d \u201cThe Government must guide the direction through regulation and support, while public\u2013private collaboration makes it work. If strong destination management is created as the foundation, marketing becomes clear and value-driven, attracting travellers who will respect and contribute to Sri Lanka,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s ensure that this island paradise delivers on its promise, by protecting what makes it special and delivering tourism that benefits both the traveller and the people of Sri Lanka,\u201d Kidd stressed.

The funds will be drawn from the Consolidated Fund or any other State-held finances, including loans secured at the discretion of the Government, for use within the 2025 financial year. In the wake of the Ditwah-related natural disasters that pummelled the country, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake last week urged Parliament to convene before the official commencement in January 2026 to approve the Rs. 50 billion estimate for 2025. He also said the Government would submit another supplementary estimate for Rs. 500 billion in January to finance relief and recovery spending in 2026. Additionally, the Committee approved regulations issued under Section 71 of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002, as published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2460/44. The Committee also convened on 3 December 2025 to review several key regulatory and financial matters, including new regulations issued under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Act, the National Audit Office\u2019s Annual Work Programme for 2026, and the Final Report on the Appropriation Bill for the 2026 financial year. During its deliberations on the NMRA regulations published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2452/39 of 4 September 2025, the Committee underscored the need to enhance system-wide transparency and visibility in the medicine registration process. Following its review, the CoPF approved the regulations. The Committee also examined the National Audit Office\u2019s Annual Work Programme for 2026, which outlines a total of 3,508 audits scheduled for the year. These include 3,484 financial audits, 11 performance audits, one environmental audit and 12 special audits. A significant addition for 2026 is the inclusion of Samurdhi Community-Based Banks and Samurdhi Community-Based Bank Societies under the Auditor General\u2019s audit mandate. The Committee raised concerns over staffing capacity to absorb the new workload. The Acting Auditor General informed members that an additional 10\u201315% staff would be required beyond the existing cadre, with pilot audits currently underway through regional offices. These pilots will continue until the end of February 2026, after which the exact human resource requirement whether through recruitment or outsourcing will be determined. The CoPF agreed to advise the Speaker that it supports the potential outsourcing of the Samurdhi-related audit work, subject to further evaluation by the Auditor General. The National Audit Office has been directed to complete its pilot project and report findings to the Committee by end-February 2026. The Committee also reviewed the Final Report submitted under Standing Order 121(5)(ii) on the Appropriation Bill for the 2026 financial year, capturing its observations and recommendations on ministerial Budget proposals and expenditure allocations. Several Members of Parliament serving on the CoPF were present at both meetings.

He said the greatest challenge is breaking the cycle in which progress is followed by repeated setbacks. \u201cOur biggest challenge is achieving sustainable and equitable development while dealing with overlapping crises. We just completed historic debt restructuring and then Cyclone Ditwah struck. Although we managed to recover from the economic crisis, our economy is still fragile and now over a million people have been affected by disaster. We have to move beyond the cycle where every achievement is temporary. We must prove that Sri Lanka remains resilient and viable,\u201d President Dissanayake told Newsweek which described the interview as candid. On geopolitical ties, Dissanayake said Sri Lanka retains the autonomy to work with major partners but does not frame those relationships as a balancing act. He said the country\u2019s ties with India are deep and historic, China remains a strategic economic partner, and the United States is Sri Lanka\u2019s largest export market. \u201cIndia is our closest neighbour and first responder. China is a strong economic and political partner. The United States and Sri Lanka also have deep ties and shared democratic values. We don\u2019t look at our relations with these important countries as balancing. Each of our relationships is important to us.\u201d On relations with Washington, he said Sri Lanka wants market access, climate finance and technology partnerships. \u201cWe need climate finance. We just lost several billions of dollars due to Cyclone Ditwah. We need grants for early warning systems, resilient infrastructure and coastal protection. We want US companies to invest in digital infrastructure, manufacturing and renewable energy. What we offer is a strategically placed, stable, democratic partner in the Indo Pacific.\u201d On debt sustainability, Dissanayake said the post-default recovery is now intersecting with climate impacts and that international frameworks must evolve. \u201cWe will have to service debt while simultaneously rebuilding from climate disasters. This is why debt sustainability frameworks for climate-vulnerable countries must change. We are increasing Government revenue, broadening our tax base through digitalisation and protecting social spending. We cannot impose austerity on people who have lost everything.\u201d He outlined the domestic relief agenda shaped by Cyclone Ditwah, including rebuilding homes, restoring agriculture and maintaining targeted subsidies. He said the Government expects these measures to provide visible relief while remaining within IMF parameters. On investment, Dissanayake said Sri Lanka is putting in place predictable rules and institutions to meet long-standing investor concerns. \u201cWe are establishing transparent, rules-based evaluation with clear criteria. Foreign investors want clarity, consistency and confidence. We have introduced a single-window approval system. We are drafting a new Investment Protection Act. There will be no special treatment for insiders. Approvals will be made on merit and national benefit.\u201d On long-running Chinese infrastructure projects, including Hambantota and Port City, he said these are commercial realities that must be managed to protect economic value and national sovereignty. \u201cThe Hambantota Port operates transparently. Our Navy and customs are in control. The lease is commercial, not military. Port City is a commercial development. We have to monitor operations, ensure compliance with Sri Lankan law and maintain sovereignty. These projects are realities that we must manage with a clear-eyed assessment of our interests.\u201d On disaster response and future preparedness, he said the Government will overhaul systems exposed by Cyclone Ditwah. \u201cCyclone Ditwah was catastrophic. Response was rapid but longstanding weaknesses were visible. We have launched a comprehensive review of disaster management systems. We will improve forecasting, pre-position equipment, and map high-risk areas. With climate change, destruction of this scale should have been expected. At least now we will put effective and accountable systems in place.\u201d He said Sri Lanka risks being trapped in a cycle of climate shocks unless investment and global support shift to resilience. \u201cWe will be trapped if we don\u2019t act now. Help us build climate-resilient infrastructure. Help us diversify our economy towards climate-resilient industries. Share technology so communities have time to evacuate. Help us build natural mitigation systems. We must break this cycle.\u201d Throughout the interview, Dissanayake used the platform to signal that recovery, geopolitical steadiness and climate adaptation form the core of his Government\u2019s economic strategy as it attempts to draw investment and rebuild confidence after successive crises.

In a 5 December dated statement Moody\u2019s said: \u201cSince mid-November, countries in South and Southeast Asia have been pummelled by several tropical cyclones which, combined with unusually heavy monsoon rains, have caused severe flooding and landslides, and the tragic loss of hundreds of lives.\u201d The agency added: \u201cThe economic, fiscal and credit impact of the disaster is likely to be most material for Sri Lanka (Caa1 stable).\u201d Moody\u2019s places Sri Lanka in a group of highly exposed countries, noting that Sri Lanka, as well as Indonesia (Baa2 stable), the Philippines (Baa2 stable) and Vietnam (Ba2 stable) all have high credit exposure to physical climate risks. \u201cSri Lanka has much weaker fiscal capacity to increase its resilience than its neighbours.\u201d These conditions, Moody\u2019s says, heighten the consequences of the current disaster for a sovereign still navigating post-default stabilisation. The agency also connects climate risk outcomes to institutional capacity. \u201cEffective governance is also key in mitigating such risks and often correlates with lower physical climate risk vulnerability in regions of high exposure. While recent reforms have led to some improvement, both Sri Lanka and Vietnam have governance issuer profile scores of 4, indicating high credit exposure to governance risks.\u201d In its wider regional view, Moody\u2019s says credit implications for other affected Governments will be more limited. Although Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam share similar climate-risk exposure, their stronger fiscal positions give them more room to respond. However, Moody\u2019s warns of broader structural vulnerabilities across the region, saying that the severity of the flooding highlights broader credit vulnerabilities to physical climate risks over the longer term, especially given limited natural catastrophe insurance coverage in the region. Last October, Moody\u2019s said Sri Lanka\u2019s macroeconomic recovery remained broadly on track. It has had expected the current account to stay in surplus in 2025, supported by tourism and remittances despite a rise in vehicle imports. But it cautioned that Sri Lanka\u2019s narrow revenue base and dependence on external financing remain key vulnerabilities if the global environment shifts. It said Sri Lanka\u2019s fiscal strength remained constrained by a high debt burden and very low debt affordability, even as reforms with development-partner support were beginning to show results. The stable outlook reflected balanced risks: further reforms could lift the rating, while weaker policy momentum or a deterioration in external buffers would put pressure on it. The agency said sustained reform momentum under the IMF program could strengthen the credit profile, while any weakening of external buffers or reversal of reforms would raise downside risks. In the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, Sri Lanka was compelled to request the IMF for additional relief. The IMF is reviewing a request for about $ 200 million Rapid Financing Instrument which is expected this year. The Fifth Review under the Extended Fund Facility was to be finalised on 15 December resulting in the release of a $ 347 million tranche provided the 2026 Budget resonated with the program parameters.

In a 5 December dated statement Moodys said Since mid-November, countries in South and Southeast Asia have been pummelled by several tropical cyclones which, combined with unusually heavy monsoon rains, have caused severe flooding and landslides, and the tragic loss of hundreds of lives. The agency added The economic, fiscal and credit impact of the disaster is likely to be most material for Sri Lanka Caa1 stable. Moodys places Sri Lanka in a group of highly exposed countries, noting that Sri Lanka, as well as Indonesia Baa2 stable, the Philippines Baa2 stable and Vietnam Ba2 stable all have high credit exposure to physical climate risks. Sri Lanka has much weaker fiscal capacity to increase its resilience than its neighbours. These conditions, Moodys says, heighten the consequences of the current disaster for a sovereign still navigating post-default stabilisation. The agency also connects climate risk outcomes to institutional capacity. Effective governance is also key in mitigating such risks and often correlates with lower physical climate risk vulnerability in regions of high exposure. While recent reforms have led to some improvement, both Sri Lanka and Vietnam have governance issuer profile scores of 4, indicating high credit exposure to governance risks. In its wider regional view, Moodys says credit implications for other affected Governments will be more limited. Although Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam share similar climate-risk exposure, their stronger fiscal positions give them more room to respond. However, Moodys warns of broader structural vulnerabilities across the region, saying that the severity of the flooding highlights broader credit vulnerabilities to physical climate risks over the longer term, especially given limited natural catastrophe insurance coverage in the region. Last October, Moodys said Sri Lankas macroeconomic recovery remained broadly on track. It has had expected the current account to stay in surplus in 2025, supported by tourism and remittances despite a rise in vehicle imports. But it cautioned that Sri Lankas narrow revenue base and dependence on external financing remain key vulnerabilities if the global environment shifts. It said Sri Lankas fiscal strength remained constrained by a high debt burden and very low debt affordability, even as reforms with development-partner support were beginning to show results. The stable outlook reflected balanced risks further reforms could lift the rating, while weaker policy momentum or a deterioration in external buffers would put pressure on it. The agency said sustained reform momentum under the IMF program could strengthen the credit profile, while any weakening of external buffers or reversal of reforms would raise downside risks. In the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, Sri Lanka was compelled to request the IMF for additional relief. The IMF is reviewing a request for about  200 million Rapid Financing Instrument which is expected this year. The Fifth Review under the Extended Fund Facility was to be finalised on 15 December resulting in the release of a  347 million tranche provided the 2026 Budget resonated with the program parameters. However, the Government and the IMF have agreed to push the review to early 2026 on account of the emerging fiscal conditions post-Ditwah.

The Fund also signalled that the next tranche\u2014previously set at about $ 347 million\u2014could be increased, subject to further evaluation. \u201cIn light of the Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 request for emergency financing, IMF Board consideration of the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) request is the priority at the current juncture,\u201d an IMF spokesperson said. The Fund added that an IMF team will visit Sri Lanka in early 2026 to resume discussions on the Fifth Review and that support under the RFI will be provided in addition to the EFF. Last week, in the immediate aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, the IMF said the Fifth Review could be concluded within two weeks. However, Sri Lanka has since asked both to raise the tranche value and to access an additional $ 200 million, requiring more time for the Board to assess the proposals. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament on Friday that the Government is temporarily stepping back from the staff-level agreement reached last month to prioritise the emergency funding request. \u201cIt had been planned to present this to their Executive Board on 15 December. But the situation has now changed. We are moving away from the staff-level agreement previously reached,\u201d he said, adding that the IMF had proposed shifting the Board discussion to January or February. Sri Lanka had been expecting the next EFF disbursement of about $ 347 million in December, with the President noting this reflected the value in Special Drawing Rights. He confirmed the Government is now seeking to expand that tranche. \u201cTo increase it, we need both negotiations and time,\u201d he said. Given the urgent foreign exchange requirement following Cyclone Ditwah, Dissanayake said the Government has turned to the Fund for immediate assistance. \u201cTo meet our immediate need for foreign exchange, we have requested relief of $ 200 million from the IMF.

Delivering the keynote at the \u2018Investment Point of View\u2019 session of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, he said the country\u2019s hard-won stability now provides a crucial opening to lift public investment, strengthen competitiveness, and scale islands of excellence in high-value sectors. \u201cFiscal consolidation must not be seen as an end in itself, but as the foundation for long-term development, serving to unlock infrastructure expansion, exports, and productivity-driven growth,\u201d he stressed. He noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery from the crisis is built on measurable gains, including a current account surplus, exceeding International Monetary Fund (IMF) targets for the primary surplus, and a projected decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio to below 95%, ahead of the IMF\u2019s 2032 timeline. However, he cautioned that maintaining this trajectory is essential for foreign and domestic investor confidence, particularly as the State cannot finance the country\u2019s development priorities alone. \u201cProgress achieved so far must now be followed by deeper reforms to improve the overall business environment,\u201d he added. He pointed to the power sector as a critical example, where unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) under the broader State-owned enterprise (SOE) restructuring agenda signals improved governance and the potential to attract investment into renewable energy. He opined that Sri Lanka will require close to $ 11 billion by 2030 to meet its climate and net-zero commitments, and that predictable power purchase agreements, transparent pricing, and adherence to global environmental and governance standards are essential to draw long-term institutional capital. He added that the World Bank Group, including the IFC, is supporting these efforts through guarantees, risk-sharing tools, and instruments designed to de-risk both equity and debt investments in the real economy. Fakhoury underscored the need to level the playing field for both domestic and foreign investors, particularly in areas such as land access and sectoral ownership restrictions. He called for stronger Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) financing, highlighting a gap equivalent to 20% of GDP, and urged swift operationalisation of the new Secured Transactions Act to unlock credit for small businesses, including women-led enterprises. Additional reforms in competition policy, labour laws, trade facilitation, and public sector governance, he said, are necessary to drive investment, enhance transparency, and reduce the costs of doing business. Fakhoury said the direction outlined in the 2026 Budget, placing private sector-led growth at the centre, reflects an essential shift. But he noted that consistent policy, minimal reversals, and rapid implementation of the Economic Transformation Act\u2019s key elements, including the public-private partnership (PPP), insolvency and investment protection laws, will determine whether Sri Lanka can scale investment and achieve durable growth. He identified renewable energy, logistics, export-oriented industries, digital services, specialised manufacturing, agribusiness, and high-value tourism as the sectors with the strongest potential to propel Sri Lanka towards its ambition of 7% annual GDP expansion. He noted that the Colombo Port\u2019s role as a critical transshipment hub can be further strengthened by focusing on efficient port operations, expanding logistics and supply chain services, and maximising port capacity to attract global investment. \u201cSri Lanka must shift decisively from an inward-focused model to an export-driven strategy through new free trade agreements (FTAs), modernised tariff policies, and smoother trade facilitation,\u201d he stressed. Highlighting that the country already hosts high-performing \u201cislands of excellence\u201d in specialised manufacturing, digital services, and niche agribusinesses, he said these should be scaled through expanded Board of Investment (BOI) and sector-specific zones, improved digital infrastructure, better STEM skills, and strong branding for premium agro-products. Fakhoury said Sri Lanka possesses all attributes needed to become one of Asia\u2019s premier destinations. To reach the goal of $ 8 billion in annual earnings and 4 million visitors, he called for a destination management framework that elevates high-value segments such as wellness, Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE), surfing, and nature-based tourism, while improving connectivity and development in the island\u2019s east and north. \u201cThe partnerships and consensus emerging from the two-day summit reflect a shared recognition that Sri Lanka\u2019s future should not be defined merely by resilience, but by competitive excellence,\u201d he said. He reiterated that the World Bank Group and IFC stand ready to support the private and public sectors as the country seeks to consolidate its recovery, accelerate investment, and position itself as a gateway to regional opportunity. \u201cSri Lanka can achieve much more than stabilisation. It can transform,\u201d he said, urging State institutions and businesses to work \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d to turn renewed confidence into sustained, job-creating growth.

Speaking at the launch, officials noted that the screen represents far more than an advertising platform, highlighting its role as a modern city landmark that elevates Unity Plaza\u2019s architectural presence and strengthens its position as Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost destination for technology products and services.

Although Sri Lanka remains locked out of international capital markets it continues to access and service loans from multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Sri Lanka settled $ 1.36 billion in external debt servicing in the first half of 2025, covering 55% of the $ 2.45 billion due for the full year, according to data from the Public Debt Management Office and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). This leaves $ 1.09 billion to be met in the second half of the year. CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe recently said that annual external debt servicing will average around $ 2.75 billion till 2027 under current commitments. From 2028 onwards, it is projected to rise, reaching between $ 3.2 billion and $ 3.5 billion, and peaking at close to $ 4 billion in certain years within the next decade, he said. According to the 3Q 2025 Debt Bulletin, multilateral lenders account for 37% of the external portfolio, followed by commercial debt at 34% and bilateral debt at 29%. ISBs continue to dominate commercial liabilities, representing roughly 81% of the category, with the balance comprised of syndicated foreign-currency term facilities. The ADB and the World Bank together make up more than 83% of multilateral exposures. Among bilateral creditors, 59% of outstanding loans are from non-Paris Club lenders, while 41% originate from Paris Club members. The bulletin records substantial progress in the external debt restructuring process since the country defaulted its debt in April 2022. On 26 June 2024, Sri Lanka concluded debt treatment agreements with the Official Creditor Committee and separately with the Export-Import Bank of China. Amendment arrangements were signed to operationalise both sets of agreements. The restructuring of loans from the China Development Bank was completed through amendment agreements on 24 December 2024. Commercial restructuring proceeded in parallel. An agreement in principle with ISB holders was reached on 19 September 2024, with the subsequent bond exchange finalised on 16 December 2024. Participation reached nearly 98%, enabling almost the entire stock of defaulted ISBs to be converted into new instruments. Progress with Paris Club creditors continued through 2025. Sri Lanka concluded bilateral amendatory agreements with Japan on 24 March 2025, with the Export-Import Bank of India on 25 March (Lines of Credit) and 3 April (Buyer\u2019s Credit Agreements), and with the Government of France on 16 June.

Although Sri Lanka remains locked out of international capital markets it continues to access and service loans from multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Sri Lanka settled  1.36 billion in external debt servicing in the first half of 2025, covering 55 of the  2.45 billion due for the full year, according to data from the Public Debt Management Office and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka CBSL. This leaves  1.09 billion to be met in the second half of the year. CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe recently said that annual external debt servicing will average around  2.75 billion till 2027 under current commitments. From 2028 onwards, it is projected to rise, reaching between  3.2 billion and  3.5 billion, and peaking at close to  4 billion in certain years within the next decade, he said. According to the 3Q 2025 Debt Bulletin, multilateral lenders account for 37 of the external portfolio, followed by commercial debt at 34 and bilateral debt at 29. ISBs continue to dominate commercial liabilities, representing roughly 81 of the category, with the balance comprised of syndicated foreign-currency term facilities. The ADB and the World Bank together make up more than 83 of multilateral exposures. Among bilateral creditors, 59 of outstanding loans are from non-Paris Club lenders, while 41 originate from Paris Club members. The bulletin records substantial progress in the external debt restructuring process since the country defaulted its debt in April 2022. On 26 June 2024, Sri Lanka concluded debt treatment agreements with the Official Creditor Committee and separately with the Export-Import Bank of China. Amendment arrangements were signed to operationalise both sets of agreements. The restructuring of loans from the China Development Bank was completed through amendment agreements on 24 December 2024. Commercial restructuring proceeded in parallel. An agreement in principle with ISB holders was reached on 19 September 2024, with the subsequent bond exchange finalised on 16 December 2024. Participation reached nearly 98, enabling almost the entire stock of defaulted ISBs to be converted into new instruments. Progress with Paris Club creditors continued through 2025. Sri Lanka concluded bilateral amendatory agreements with Japan on 24 March 2025, with the Export-Import Bank of India on 25 March Lines of Credit and 3 April Buyers Credit Agreements, and with the Government of France on 16 June. Agreements with EXIM Bank of Hungary on 01 July and the United Kingdom on 22 August brought total completion of restructuring commitments to about 94 More recently, SriLankan Airlines reached an agreement in principles with external Bondholders holding  175 million worth of debt instruments.

The financing agreement was signed on 3 December 2025 by Treasury Secretary Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma and World Bank Division Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, David N. Sislen, representing the Government of Sri Lanka and the IDA, respectively. A statement issued by the Finance Ministry External Resources Department noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s current grid capacity has become a major constraint in integrating additional renewable energy, posing significant technical challenges. The new project is designed to expand and modernise grid infrastructure to accommodate higher volumes of clean power in line with the national policy target of generating 70% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The initiative will also be supported by a proposed World Bank payment guarantee facility intended to scale up private sector investment in renewable energy projects. Through a range of financial instruments, the broader program aims to unlock private capital, strengthen institutional capacity, and ensure a stable and affordable power supply. The total project cost is estimated at $ 60 million. The World Bank will provide $ 30 million under the first phase, while the remaining $ 30 million is expected under a second phase of financing. The loan facility is expected to be on-lent to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which will implement the project in collaboration with the Energy Ministry and other relevant agencies.

They are out of place in a democracy. We are committed to comprehensive reform. On the PTA, we are committed to repealing and replacing it with legislation that balances security concerns with civil liberties,\u201d the President said. \u201cThis means ending indefinite detention, establishing judicial oversight, and ensuring that anti-terrorism legislation meets international human rights standards.\u201d He said revisions to the Online Safety Act will protect free expression while addressing genuine harms, noting that governments create new risks when they rush through restrictive laws. \u201cThe focus is to prevent real harm and not silence criticism. We want to work with civil society, international human rights experts, and affected communities to draft replacement legislation. Trust in Government requires these reforms. We will act. And act soon.\u201d Responding to concerns from rights-conscious partners, Dissanayake said credibility will come from concrete steps rather than declarations. \u201cTrust is earned through action. We are releasing political prisoners systematically, reviewing cases where people were detained without proper process, allowing space for peaceful protests, and strengthening independent institutions. The political culture of control does not change overnight. Our partners should see whether our reforms are substantive and whether we are advancing, not backsliding.\u201d Asked whether the country can put its troubled past behind it, he said the aim is not to erase history but to prevent repetition. \u201cYou cannot overcome the loss of thousands of lives in conflict or the trauma of disappearances and torture. What we can do is ensure these horrors never recur. We cannot forget the past, but we can build institutions that protect everyone equally and break the cycles that produced those painful experiences.\u201d Dissanayake said constitutional reform, equal citizenship, accountability, and protection of vulnerable communities are essential to a durable rights-based order. He said the long-term test will be whether future generations inherit stronger institutions rather than unresolved grievances.

We cannot forget the past, but we can build institutions that protect everyone equally and break the cycles that produced those painful experiences. Dissanayake said constitutional reform, equal citizenship, accountability, and protection of vulnerable communities are essential to a durable rights-based order. He said the long-term test will be whether future generations inherit stronger institutions rather than unresolved grievances.

The performance also pushes year-to-date (YTD) arrivals to over 2.14 million, marking a 16.3% growth compared with the same period last year. India continued its lead as Sri Lanka\u2019s largest tourist source market during the first week of December, contributing 8,890 arrivals, or 21% of the total. It was followed by Russia with 4,735 travellers, Germany with 4,399 visitors, the UK with 3,053, and China with 2,571 tourists. Other notable contributors included travellers from Australia, Poland, France, the US, and Spain. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has projected 344,309 arrivals for December. Based on current trends and the daily average of 6,190 visitors registered in the first week, it appears that the country is well-placed to meet this forecast. Cumulatively, India has driven the strongest inflows YTD with 483,785 visitors, followed by the UK with 194,795, Russia with 163,328, Germany with 135,658, and China with 124,242. The strength of India and the European markets has been instrumental in sustaining double-digit growth throughout the year. If the country achieves the expected December total, annual arrivals for 2025 will likely close at around 2.44-2.45 million. This outcome fits neatly within the SLTDA\u2019s \u2018Lower Scenario\u2019 of 2.415 million and aligns closely with external projections such as CT Smith Securities\u2019 estimate of 2.4 million arrivals for the year. Sri Lanka originally targeted 3 million arrivals and $ 5 billion in tourism earnings for 2025. The SLTDA later revised expectations into three forecast paths: a \u2018Lower Scenario\u2019 of 2.415 million arrivals, a \u2018Conservative Scenario\u2019 of 2.676 million, and an \u2018Optimistic Scenario\u2019 of 3 million. Assessing the current performance, it places the country firmly within the lower range and possibly edging towards the \u2018Conservative Scenario\u2019 depending on December\u2019s final numbers. However, the optimistic target of 3 million remains out of reach. A recent sector analysis by CT Smith Securities reinforces this view, projecting 2.4 million arrivals and $ 3.4 billion in earnings for 2025. The report noted that while the industry has made one of its strongest recoveries since the disruptions of 2019 to 2022, the time needed for long-haul source markets to fully scale up and capacity limitations across the sector mean that exponential year-end growth is unlikely. It added that the outlook for 2026 is more upbeat, with visitor numbers expected to reach 3 million and tourism revenue projected at $ 4.3 billion. The strong first-week performance provides further momentum, suggesting that December\u2019s full-month arrival requirement is well within reach. This was further cemented by leading industry associations\u2014The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) and Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO)\u2014reassuring that the outlook for the season remains strong, supported by coordinated industry action, strong diplomatic engagement, and reaffirmed confidence from global travel partners. Even with the unlikelihood of reaching the ambitious original target, the industry experts noted that Sri Lanka is poised to close 2025 with its highest post-crisis performance. \u201cThe resilience shown during the first week of December, in spite of weather-related disruptions, underscores renewed confidence in the destination and strengthens the foundation for tourism growth heading into 2026,\u201d they added.

The relief scheme adds fiscal pressure at a time when the Treasury is attempting to consolidate public finances under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. But the Government has signalled that immediate stabilisation of disaster-affected areas takes precedence, with financing routed mainly through the Defence Ministry and implemented via Divisional Secretariats nationwide. Although the Circular does not indicate the total fiscal outlay, the scale of payments suggests a significant expenditure at a time when the Government is attempting to rebuild confidence following 2022\u2019s external debt standstill. On Friday, President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake addressing Parliament said the Government would submit a Rs. 50 billion supplementary estimate for immediate relief spending for 2025 and a separate Rs. 500 billion for 2026. He said that a request has been made to the IMF to allow the country to access $ 200 million from special drawing rights. The IMF was also requested that the next $ 347 million tranche under the External Fund Facility (EFF) due later this month to be increased. The recent measures, set out in the Finance Ministry Budget Circular No. 08/2025 of 5 December, outline direct cash transfers, housing reconstruction grants, and sector-specific compensation for farmers, small enterprises, and fishing communities. According to the Circular, households will receive a one-time payment of Rs. 25,000 to clean and safely re-enter homes affected by flooding and landslides. Families whose kitchens or essential living spaces have been rendered unusable will be granted Rs. 50,000. Additional resettlement allowances are available for families requiring temporary shelter, including up to Rs. 25,000 per month for those whose homes were fully destroyed. The largest fiscal commitments relate to housing reconstruction, payments of up to Rs. 5 million, will be provided to families whose houses were completely damaged, either for rebuilding on existing land or purchasing a new plot where State land cannot be allocated. Partially damaged homes may qualify for up to Rs. 250,000, subject to on-site assessment by officials. Agriculture, one of the sectors most disrupted by the cyclone, will receive compensation for crop and livestock losses. Farmers may claim Rs. 150,000 per hectare for paddy, grains, and field crops, and Rs. 200,000 per hectare for vegetable cultivation. Registered livestock farmers will be paid Rs. 20,000 per animal lost. Small industries and micro-enterprises may receive Rs. 200,000 per unit to restore machinery and resume operations, while fishers may receive up to Rs. 400,000 for damaged vessels. The Government also announced payments of Rs. 15,000 to support schoolchildren affected by the disaster, along with Rs. 1 million to families of those who died or were rendered permanently disabled. The Finance Ministry said that the scheme must be administered with strict verification processes, referencing earlier disaster-relief circulars that govern damage assessment. The guidelines stipulate that duplicate claims are prohibited and that certain categories of relief must be adjusted to account for earlier payments made under separate disaster-relief programs. The relief package applies only to areas formally designated as disaster zones following Cyclone Ditwah, but may be used in addition to other Government assistance schemes now underway.

The relief scheme adds fiscal pressure at a time when the Treasury is attempting to consolidate public finances under the International Monetary Fund IMF program. But the Government has signalled that immediate stabilisation of disaster-affected areas takes precedence, with financing routed mainly through the Defence Ministry and implemented via Divisional Secretariats nationwide. Although the Circular does not indicate the total fiscal outlay, the scale of payments suggests a significant expenditure at a time when the Government is attempting to rebuild confidence following 2022s external debt standstill. On Friday, President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake addressing Parliament said the Government would submit a Rs. 50 billion supplementary estimate for immediate relief spending for 2025 and a separate Rs. 500 billion for 2026. He said that a request has been made to the IMF to allow the country to access  200 million from special drawing rights. The IMF was also requested that the next  347 million tranche under the External Fund Facility EFF due later this month to be increased. The recent measures, set out in the Finance Ministry Budget Circular No. 082025 of 5 December, outline direct cash transfers, housing reconstruction grants, and sector-specific compensation for farmers, small enterprises, and fishing communities. According to the Circular, households will receive a one-time payment of Rs. 25,000 to clean and safely re-enter homes affected by flooding and landslides. Families whose kitchens or essential living spaces have been rendered unusable will be granted Rs. 50,000. Additional resettlement allowances are available for families requiring temporary shelter, including up to Rs. 25,000 per month for those whose homes were fully destroyed. The largest fiscal commitments relate to housing reconstruction, payments of up to Rs. 5 million, will be provided to families whose houses were completely damaged, either for rebuilding on existing land or purchasing a new plot where State land cannot be allocated. Partially damaged homes may qualify for up to Rs. 250,000, subject to on-site assessment by officials. Agriculture, one of the sectors most disrupted by the cyclone, will receive compensation for crop and livestock losses. Farmers may claim Rs. 150,000 per hectare for paddy, grains, and field crops, and Rs. 200,000 per hectare for vegetable cultivation. Registered livestock farmers will be paid Rs. 20,000 per animal lost. Small industries and micro-enterprises may receive Rs. 200,000 per unit to restore machinery and resume operations, while fishers may receive up to Rs. 400,000 for damaged vessels. The Government also announced payments of Rs. 15,000 to support schoolchildren affected by the disaster, along with Rs. 1 million to families of those who died or were rendered permanently disabled. The Finance Ministry said that the scheme must be administered with strict verification processes, referencing earlier disaster-relief circulars that govern damage assessment. The guidelines stipulate that duplicate claims are prohibited and that certain categories of relief must be adjusted to account for earlier payments made under separate disaster-relief programs. The relief package applies only to areas formally designated as disaster zones following Cyclone Ditwah, but may be used in addition to other Government assistance schemes now underway. Officials have been instructed to implement the measures immediately, with payments channelled through local administrations under Treasury oversight.

Nandalal Weerasinghe \u2013 Pic by Ruwan Walpola Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe has warned that Sri Lanka cannot afford to forget the reform agenda that underpins the country\u2019s stabilisation, even as post-Ditwah reconstruction demands immediate Government attention. Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, he said the country\u2019s foundation for growth remains fragile and depends on discipline in macroeconomic management and the timely implementation of structural reforms. \u201cThe stability that we have basically achieved is a foundation for growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen going forward, we need to ensure we maintain monetary stability, fiscal stability, and also external stability. That is important, and also financial stability. So, when going forward, for us to move into a higher growth path, we should not weaken the foundation for stability.\u201d He warned that the reform trajectory must not be derailed by the disaster response. \u201cWe should not forget that we need to focus on this area,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these short-term shocks we can absorb. I am sure the fiscal space is there. We can manage that. I am not too concerned about that.\u201d Dr. Weerasinghe said the Central Bank expects supply chain disruptions from the cyclone to cause only a brief increase in inflation. \u201cWe might see a small uptick in inflation as a result of these supply chain disruptions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is something we do not have to worry about. But that could reflect, given the real inflation environment. This 2 percent inflation going up to 3 percent will not be a surprise, given the short-term impact.\u201d He said inflation should revert once bottlenecks clear. \u201cOver a period of time, once supply chain issues are addressed, I would say we will come back to the normal inflation trajectory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will maintain stability going forward, as we have been doing so far under the framework.\u201d He also said the cyclone will not produce a major balance of payments shock. \u201cExternal impact, I do not see as a significant impact from this event,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we see is an immediate impact that will be more cyclical.\u201d Reviewing global risks, he said earlier concerns over US tariff policy had eased. \u201cWe had a lot of concerns at that point. Now we can see that it has been softening in terms of its impact on Sri Lanka as well as other markets,\u201d he said. \u201cCompared to where we were, that issue, I think, to a certain extent is again stabilising in my view.\u201d He noted that political developments and energy prices remain uncertainties, though Sri Lanka\u2019s rising reliance on renewable energy mitigates exposure to global price swings. Domestically, he said pent-up demand for agricultural imports had temporarily pushed the current account into a small deficit, but this was normalising. \u201cNow we can see that this is also settling down,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, we saw some pressure on the external side last month. Now it is gradually settling down.\u201d The CBSL Governor downplayed the impact of global interest rate changes. \u201cI do not see that as a significant impact on our balance of payments side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have much exposure to these kinds of global interest rates.\u201d However, he cautioned that disruptions in supply chains could present modest challenges for exporters. \u201cThis impact could be a small shock in terms of supply chain disruption, especially for our suppliers here,\u201d Dr. Weerasinghe said. \u201cThat we will have to manage.\u201d On medium-term growth, Dr. Weerasinghe said Sri Lanka must convert consumption-led demand into investment. Sovereign rating improvements, trade reforms and productivity gains are essential conditions, he said. \u201cI think we are hoping that there will be an improvement in this rating,\u201d he said. \u201cFacilitation through reforms, making the business environment easier through some of the reforms already included in the World Bank budget support programme, those are very important reforms.\u201d He highlighted reducing non-tariff barriers, labour productivity reforms and stronger regional integration as priorities. \u201cWe need to have important reforms implemented to improve the productivity of labour and also reduce the barriers to trade and have access to regional markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Government has made a decision to link up with RCEP. This is a very important link-up for supply chains in the region for us to have much more open trade.\u201d He closed by reiterating that stability must be actively maintained. \u201cWe will maintain stability going forward, as we have been doing so far under the framework,\u201d he said.

A discussion meeting was held recently at the EDB premises, with the participation of Secretary to the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Tilaka Jayasundara, EDB Chairman and CEO Mangala Wijesinghe, Acting Director General Erandika Dissanayake, Acting Additional Director General Kumudinie Mudalige, Trade Facilitation and Trade Information Director Dr. Sanjeewa Rathnasekara along with senior officials and exporters. The EDB has already commenced comprehensive damage assessments of exporters most affected by the adverse weather conditions. These assessments will guide the targeted relief interventions required for the export sector. EDB Chairman emphasised that strategic interventions are actively underway to tackle immediate challenges facing the export sector. These measures focus on minimising disruptions to export operations to ensure a steady flow of goods and services to international markets. Additionally, efforts are being made to mitigate the adverse impact on production capacity, safeguarding the ability of exporters to maintain output levels. A key priority is also placed on reactivating disrupted supply chains, restoring the seamless connectivity essential for efficient production and export processes. Through these targeted actions, the EDB aims to sustain export growth and build resilience against short-term obstacles. The EDB is currently working closely with customs, port authorities, and logistics providers to manage infrastructure delays caused by adverse weather conditions and expedite export-related clearances. Special Government attention has now been focused on assisting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in particular to rapidly reactivate their operational capacity during this recovery process. The discussion highlighted the growing intensity and frequency of climate-related challenges in recent times, underscoring the urgent need for proactive and sustainable responses. It was emphasised that addressing these environmental issues is not only critical for mitigating risks but also essential for ensuring long-term economic resilience. By integrating sustainability into export practices and promoting green technologies, the EDB aims to strengthen the export sector\u2019s competitiveness and sustainability. This approach seeks to support exporters in adapting to climate realities while fostering greener and more resilient trade pathways that align with global environmental goals.

Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit last week, Sood said Axiata\u2019s investment decisions are never driven solely by shareholder returns, but by a broader \u2018return to stakeholders\u2019, shaped by a country\u2019s vision, regulatory stability, market structure, macroeconomic signals and the strength of local talent. \u201cEvery business has to decide, where to put its capital.

Pathfinder Foundation Chairman Bernard Goonetilleke, in his opening remarks stressed the importance of sound fiscal governance in the wake of the socio-political crises experienced in Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh in recent years\u2014which indicate that South Asia can no longer treat fiscal policy as secondary or routine. His remarks concluded on the note that the discussion was of vital importance in the wake of the catastrophic cyclone that ravaged Sri Lanka the previous week.

However, it is by no means insurmountable. The well-established and highly coordinated industry network is fully geared to confront these issues head-on. While some tea-growing areas in the Uva and the Central Province experienced some impact, there has been no loss of manufacturing capacity,\u201d the Association noted in a statement yesterday. It added that the damage was largely confined to specific roads, resulting in temporary disruptions to transportation. Some of the key routes connecting plantations to the city have now been reopened, and transport services are resuming normal operations. \u201cThe harvesting operations are gradually returning to normal, with access roads been reopened and temporary access roads been constructed to facilitate transport of green leaf and produce. The majority of plantations and smallholder lands in the South of the Island along with the main road network have been spared from cyclone damage. As a result, harvesting, manufacturing and transportation activities are continuing as usual,\u201d it noted. CTTA stated that the trading activities at the Colombo Tea Auctions continue to be held albeit with a revised calendar. The Tea Auction previously set for the first week of December has been rescheduled to the last week of December. This adjustment ensures uninterrupted financial flows to the Producers, including Smallholders, maintaining the momentum of the industry. \u201cThe rise of the Kelani River and the resulting floods affected a limited number of exporters\u2019 offices and warehouses. The floods have now receded and on an initial assessment it has been observed that some of the machinery such as tea bagging machines are damaged. The industry is working tirelessly to restore the damaged machinery and are fully equipped to serve the overseas clients without interruptions and assure timely delivery as usual,\u201d it added. Sri Lanka tea production from January to October is over 220.9 million kilograms (220,972,295 kilos) recording an increase of 3,318,755 kilos compared to same period of last year.

The Cyclone Ditwah, which recently affected Sri Lanka, presents yet another challenge for the tea industry. However, it is by no means insurmountable. The well-established and highly coordinated industry network is fully geared to confront these issues head-on. While some tea-growing areas in the Uva and the Central Province experienced some impact, there has been no loss of manufacturing capacity, the Association noted in a statement yesterday. It added that the damage was largely confined to specific roads, resulting in temporary disruptions to transportation. Some of the key routes connecting plantations to the city have now been reopened, and transport services are resuming normal operations. The harvesting operations are gradually returning to normal, with access roads been reopened and temporary access roads been constructed to facilitate transport of green leaf and produce. The majority of plantations and smallholder lands in the South of the Island along with the main road network have been spared from cyclone damage. As a result, harvesting, manufacturing and transportation activities are continuing as usual, it noted. CTTA stated that the trading activities at the Colombo Tea Auctions continue to be held albeit with a revised calendar. The Tea Auction previously set for the first week of December has been rescheduled to the last week of December. This adjustment ensures uninterrupted financial flows to the Producers, including Smallholders, maintaining the momentum of the industry. The rise of the Kelani River and the resulting floods affected a limited number of exporters offices and warehouses. The floods have now receded and on an initial assessment it has been observed that some of the machinery such as tea bagging machines are damaged. The industry is working tirelessly to restore the damaged machinery and are fully equipped to serve the overseas clients without interruptions and assure timely delivery as usual, it added. Sri Lanka tea production from January to October is over 220.9 million kilograms 220,972,295 kilos recording an increase of 3,318,755 kilos compared to same period of last year. The production in 2025 also surpasses the production of 2023 in a similar period.

Speaking during a panel discussion last week at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Herath clarified that the project stems from a tender initiated several years ago, prior to the current administration. He said since assuming office, the Government has engaged in multiple negotiation rounds to align Sinopec\u2019s proposal with the original tender conditions. In January 2025, Chinese State-owned oil and gas giant China Petrochemical Corporation, commonly known as Sinopec, entered into an agreement with the Sri Lankan Government to expedite the construction of a state-of-the-art $ 3.7 billion oil refinery in the investment zone near Hambantota International Port (HIP). The agreement includes provisions to fast-track unresolved issues related to water access, land allocation, and taxes, marking the largest single foreign direct investment (FDI) in Sri Lanka\u2019s history. Herath noted that while Sinopec had sought greater access to the domestic market citing shifts in global market dynamics since the original bid was submitted, the Government has maintained a firm position that it cannot deviate from the terms of the tender, which was strictly for an export-oriented facility. \u201cNegotiations have been completed. The final offer has gone to Sinopec. We believe we will have feedback and hopefully a confirmation within a matter of days,\u201d he said. Once Sinopec conveys its official position, the agreement will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval. Herath underscored that both the Government and Sinopec remain committed to finalising the deal. Calling it a \u201csignificant investment for the country,\u201d he said the project has the potential to be one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest export-oriented ventures and stressed that its successful conclusion would mark a major milestone for the new administration\u2019s investment push. \u201cWe expect this to happen before the end of the year,\u201d Herath added, reaffirming confidence that the long-delayed project is now nearing closure.

The unveiling signals the completion of Unity Plaza\u2019s ambitious redevelopment journey that began with its relaunch in November 2023.

It strengthens Unity Plaza\u2019s prominence as the nation\u2019s leading IT hub while reshaping Colombo\u2019s commercial corridor with a contemporary visual identity. Speaking at the launch, officials noted that the screen represents far more than an advertising platform, highlighting its role as a modern city landmark that elevates Unity Plaza\u2019s architectural presence and strengthens its position as Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost destination for technology products and services.

The JXG Holistic Leadership Summit 2025 which unfolded recently was designed to future-proof the business, creating a replicable model for how companies can retain top talent and drive sustainable growth in uncertain times. The unconventional leadership event was a curated journey of introspection, dialogue, and renewal, helping leaders align personal well-being with professional impact. The inspiring convergence united senior leaders from the Group with two internationally acclaimed facilitators; Nick Jonsson, a renowned speaker and author, widely recognised for his advocacy of mental health in executive leadership, and complementing his insights was Dona Amelia, a Southeast Asian entrepreneur and empowerment coach celebrated for her transformative journey and leadership impact.

A highlight of the summit was the inspiring panel discussion titled \u2018The Future of Leadership is Holistic \u2013 Are We Ready?\u2019 featuring JXG\u2019s own senior leaders. Their candid insights offered a window into how holistic practices are being integrated throughout the Group, from talent development and performance management to culture-building and strategic decision-making. The conversation strengthened JXG\u2019s vision of leadership being a shared culture of trust, growth, and collective energy. Throughout the summit, one message resonated clearly: when leaders nurture their emotional, mental, physical, social, and psychological well-being, they create ripple effects which can strengthen teams, build innovation, and drive long-term organisational success. Leadership then becomes more than achieving results, but about building healthier, more connected, and future-ready organisations.

Q: How would you characterise JKH\u2019s Q2 performance against the broader economic backdrop? Niroshan: The macro environment has clearly stabilised, with inflation around 5%, a steadier currency and interest rates in the high single digits. Tourism has exceeded 1.97 million arrivals, growing double digits, and remittances remain strong. This has supported consumption, with Supermarkets and Consumer Foods seeing low to mid-teens growth in volumes and same store sales. In this environment, JKH reported an 88% rise in revenue to Rs. 144.8 billion in Q2. The New Energy Vehicle business (JKCG/BYD) handed over about 3,700 units and has more than 3,800 orders in the pipeline. EBITDA more than doubled to Rs. 18.4 billion, with PBT up 243% and PAT up 176%. Leisure moved from a loss to an EBITDA profit, and City of Dreams Sri Lanka, though still in its launch phase, was already close to EBITDA breakeven. The Group\u2019s broader confidence in its strategy and cash generation ability was also reflected in the doubling of its first interim dividend to Rs. 0.10 per share; a Rs. 1.8-billion payout. Sachintha: Performance was broadly in line with expectations, but particularly strong where structural tailwinds exist. Retail remained a standout, led by BYD, though the customs dispute and broader policy headwinds around EV imports remain near term challenges. Nations Trust Bank delivered another strong quarter as well, supporting Financial Services. Transportation posted solid volume growth but margins were affected by an unfavourable cargo mix, even as CWIT scaled faster than expected and SAGT benefitted from higher throughput at the Port of Colombo. City of Dreams Sri Lanka was almost at EBITDA breakeven. Despite finance costs from newly operational components, gearing remains comfortable and the core businesses continue to generate strong cash flows. Q: What are the key indicators that demonstrate the Group\u2019s underlying resilience? Niroshan: The clearest indicator is the step up in earnings. First half EBITDA reached Rs. 31.3 billion, up 98%, and the Group is on track to exceed last year\u2019s Rs. 45.7 billion. Even excluding CODSL and JKCG, Q2 PBT rose to about Rs. 4.3 billion from Rs. 1.6 billion, showing how broad based the improvement is. Operating cash flow over the last twelve months is around Rs. 41.3 billion, with Rs. 2.9 billion generated this quarter alone, supporting commitments as the Group moves from investment to harvest mode. ROCE has improved to roughly 3.5% on a last 12 months basis; still below pre crisis levels but clearly trending up. Sachintha: A major factor is that JKH has now completed its heavy capex cycle and moved into a phase focused on generating returns. Recurring EBITDA has strengthened, making cash flows more predictable. With rising earnings, improving cash generation and a stable near term capex outlook, the Group is well placed to meet upcoming obligations comfortably. Q: How comfortable are you with JKH\u2019s balance sheet, gearing and management of financial risk? Sachintha: As at 30 September 2025, gearing was around 32%, or closer to 30% excluding JKCG\u2019s trade facilities, which is very manageable for a conglomerate of this scale. The debt maturity profile is weighted toward FY26 and FY27, but the Group has ample refinancing flexibility. Currency and interest rate exposure are managed through a mix of Rupee and US dollar balances and by aligning borrowings with the broader debt profile. Strong foreign currency contributions from Leisure and Transportation add liquidity and help absorb movements in both the Rupee and global interest rates. Meanwhile, the borrowing book is actively balanced across fixed, variable and hedged positions. Niroshan: Net debt to EBITDA is about 3.5 times, a marked improvement from 8.4 times in FY2020/21. The Group\u2019s liquidity is solid, supported by operating cash flows, and it has moved beyond the capital-intensive phase of projects like CODSL. Furthermore, noncurrent borrowings exceed current obligations, reducing near term refinancing risk, and a refinancing planned for next year should extend maturities and improve the overall cost of debt. Thus, for a diversified group of its size, the financial positioning is healthy and manageable. Q: JKH has gone through a heavy capex phase. How do you view the investment strategy and return profile of assets like City of Dreams and West Container Terminal? Niroshan: City of Dreams Sri Lanka is a landmark $ 1.2 billion investment. The Nuwa Sri Lanka hotel, the first phase of The Shoppes mall and the luxury casino all opened in August 2025, and the project is now fully operational with no further outflows. The resort\u2019s EBITDA loss narrowed to Rs. 64 million in Q2, versus about Rs. 1.2 billion a year earlier, supported by rising occupancies, casino footfall and MICE bookings. The West Container Terminal is also progressing well; Phase 2 is underway and full completion is targeted for end 2026. WCT 1 is expected to be close to PAT breakeven this financial year, ahead of the typical first full year trajectory for a project of this scale.

Q How would you characterise JKHs Q2 performance against the broader economic backdrop? Niroshan The macro environment has clearly stabilised, with inflation around 5, a steadier currency and interest rates in the high single digits. Tourism has exceeded 1.97 million arrivals, growing double digits, and remittances remain strong. This has supported consumption, with Supermarkets and Consumer Foods seeing low to mid-teens growth in volumes and same store sales. In this environment, JKH reported an 88 rise in revenue to Rs. 144.8 billion in Q2. The New Energy Vehicle business JKCGBYD handed over about 3,700 units and has more than 3,800 orders in the pipeline. EBITDA more than doubled to Rs. 18.4 billion, with PBT up 243 and PAT up 176. Leisure moved from a loss to an EBITDA profit, and City of Dreams Sri Lanka, though still in its launch phase, was already close to EBITDA breakeven. The Groups broader confidence in its strategy and cash generation ability was also reflected in the doubling of its first interim dividend to Rs. 0.10 per share a Rs. 1.8-billion payout. Sachintha Performance was broadly in line with expectations, but particularly strong where structural tailwinds exist. Retail remained a standout, led by BYD, though the customs dispute and broader policy headwinds around EV imports remain near term challenges. Nations Trust Bank delivered another strong quarter as well, supporting Financial Services. Transportation posted solid volume growth but margins were affected by an unfavourable cargo mix, even as CWIT scaled faster than expected and SAGT benefitted from higher throughput at the Port of Colombo. City of Dreams Sri Lanka was almost at EBITDA breakeven. Despite finance costs from newly operational components, gearing remains comfortable and the core businesses continue to generate strong cash flows. Q What are the key indicators that demonstrate the Groups underlying resilience? Niroshan The clearest indicator is the step up in earnings. First half EBITDA reached Rs. 31.3 billion, up 98, and the Group is on track to exceed last years Rs. 45.7 billion. Even excluding CODSL and JKCG, Q2 PBT rose to about Rs. 4.3 billion from Rs. 1.6 billion, showing how broad based the improvement is. Operating cash flow over the last twelve months is around Rs. 41.3 billion, with Rs. 2.9 billion generated this quarter alone, supporting commitments as the Group moves from investment to harvest mode. ROCE has improved to roughly 3.5 on a last 12 months basis still below pre crisis levels but clearly trending up. Sachintha A major factor is that JKH has now completed its heavy capex cycle and moved into a phase focused on generating returns. Recurring EBITDA has strengthened, making cash flows more predictable. With rising earnings, improving cash generation and a stable near term capex outlook, the Group is well placed to meet upcoming obligations comfortably. Q How comfortable are you with JKHs balance sheet, gearing and management of financial risk? Sachintha As at 30 September 2025, gearing was around 32, or closer to 30 excluding JKCGs trade facilities, which is very manageable for a conglomerate of this scale. The debt maturity profile is weighted toward FY26 and FY27, but the Group has ample refinancing flexibility. Currency and interest rate exposure are managed through a mix of Rupee and US dollar balances and by aligning borrowings with the broader debt profile. Strong foreign currency contributions from Leisure and Transportation add liquidity and help absorb movements in both the Rupee and global interest rates. Meanwhile, the borrowing book is actively balanced across fixed, variable and hedged positions. Niroshan Net debt to EBITDA is about 3.5 times, a marked improvement from 8.4 times in FY202021. The Groups liquidity is solid, supported by operating cash flows, and it has moved beyond the capital-intensive phase of projects like CODSL. Furthermore, noncurrent borrowings exceed current obligations, reducing near term refinancing risk, and a refinancing planned for next year should extend maturities and improve the overall cost of debt. Thus, for a diversified group of its size, the financial positioning is healthy and manageable. Q JKH has gone through a heavy capex phase. How do you view the investment strategy and return profile of assets like City of Dreams and West Container Terminal? Niroshan City of Dreams Sri Lanka is a landmark  1.2 billion investment. The Nuwa Sri Lanka hotel, the first phase of The Shoppes mall and the luxury casino all opened in August 2025, and the project is now fully operational with no further outflows. The resorts EBITDA loss narrowed to Rs. 64 million in Q2, versus about Rs. 1.2 billion a year earlier, supported by rising occupancies, casino footfall and MICE bookings. The West Container Terminal is also progressing well Phase 2 is underway and full completion is targeted for end 2026. WCT 1 is expected to be close to PAT breakeven this financial year, ahead of the typical first full year trajectory for a project of this scale. Sachintha JKH is now moving past its most capex-intensive phase, with major projects like City of Dreams Sri Lanka and the West Container Terminal entering their operational ramps. COD is still early in its lifecycle, but the initial traction shows that the asset has the potential to scale meaningfully as tourism and MICE-related activity improve.

The new plan is split into mid- term imperatives for fiscal years 2024 through 2026, and mid-long-term actions to be carried out through 2030. Nissan President and Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida said: \u201cThe Arc plan shows our path to the future. It illustrates our continuous progression and ability to navigate changing market conditions. This plan will enable us to go further and faster in driving value and competitiveness. Faced with extreme market volatility, Nissan is taking decisive actions guided by the new plan to ensure sustainable growth and profitability.\u201d Under the two-part plan, Nissan will first take actions to ensure volume growth through a tailored regional strategy and prepare for an accelerated transition to EVs, supported by a balanced electrified/ICE product portfolio, volume growth in major markets and financial discipline. Through these initiatives Nissan aims to lift annual sales by 1 million units and increase its operating profit margin to more than 6%, both by the end of fiscal year 2026. This will pave the way for the second part of the plan aimed to enable the EV transition and realize long- term profitable growth, supported by smart partnerships, enhanced EV competitiveness, differentiated innovations and new revenue streams. By fiscal year 2030, Nissan sees a revenue potential of 2.5 trillion yen from new business opportunities. Nissan plans to launch 30 new models over the next three years, of which 16 will be electrified, and 14 will be ICE models, to meet the diversified customer needs in markets where the pace of electrification differs. Nissan plans to launch a total of 34 electrified models from fiscal year 2024 and 2030 to cover all segments, with the model mix of electrified vehicles expected to account for 40% globally by fiscal year 2026 and rise to 60% by the end of the decade. In key regions and markets, Nissan\u2019s actions by fiscal year 2026 (unless otherwise indicated) include: The product offensive will be supported by new development and manufacturing approaches aimed to make EVs more affordable and increase profitability. By developing EVs in families, integrating powertrains, utilizing next-generation modular manufacturing, group sourcing, and battery innovations, Nissan aims to reduce the cost of next-generation EVs by 30% (when compared to the current model Ariya crossover) and achieve cost-parity between EVs and ICE models by fiscal year 2030. In the area of family development alone, the cost of subsequent vehicles \u2013 those developed based on the main vehicle in the family \u2013 can be reduced by 50%, the variation of trim parts reduced by 70% and development lead time shortened by four months. By adopting modular manufacturing, the vehicle production line will be shortened, reducing the production time per vehicle by 20%. Under the Arc plan, more plants in Japan and overseas will adopt the Nissan Intelligent Factory concept, with the Oppama and Nissan Motor Kyushu plants in Japan, the Sunderland Plant in the UK and Canton and Smyrna plants in the U.S. starting the adoption from fiscal year 2026 through 2030. Meanwhile the EV36Zero production approach will be extended from Sunderland in the UK to plants including Canton, Decherd and Smyrna in the U.S., and Tochigi and Kyushu in Japan from fiscal year 2025 through 2028. The plan includes proposals to accelerate the evolution of vehicle intelligence technologies such as next-generation ProPILOT driver-assistance system, which realize door-to-door autonomous driving technology from on-highway to off- highway, private premises, and parking. Nissan will offer enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all solid-state batteries to provide diversified EVs to meet different customer needs. Nissan will significantly enhance NCM li-ion batteries, reducing quick-charging time by 50% and increasing energy density by 50% compared to the Ariya. LFP batteries, to be developed and produced in Japan, will be launched that will reduce cost by 30% compared to the Sakura EV minivehicle. New EVs with enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all-solid-state batteries will be launched in fiscal year 2028. Nissan will harness strategic partnerships to stay competitive and offer a global portfolio of products and technology. Nissan will continue to leverage the alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors in Europe, LATAM, ASEAN and India. In China, Nissan will fully utilize its local assets to meet the needs of China and beyond; and explore new partnerships in Japan and the U.S. Batteries will be developed and sourced with partners to bring 135 gigawatt hours of global capacity. Underpinning the plan is firm financial discipline, enabling stable CAPEX and R&D investment ratio versus net revenue of between 7% to 8% excluding battery capacity investment. Additionally, Nissan plans to invest more than 400 billion yen in battery capacity. Meanwhile, investment in electrification will increase progressively, becoming more than 70% by fiscal year 2026. Managing these investments is aimed to allow delivering benefits to all stakeholders, with Nissan maintaining positive free cash flow before M&A \u2013 even after electrification investments. This is to secure total shareholder return at more than 30%. Nissan aims to maintain net cash at a healthy level of 1 trillion yen throughout the Arc plan period. \u201cUnder this comprehensive plan we will enhance Nissan\u2019s competitiveness and achieve sustainable profitability,\u201d added Uchida. \u201cNissan is confident that it has what it takes to properly execute this plan, which will provide us with the firm foundation we need to bridge to our Nissan Ambition 2030 vision.\u201d", "content_hash": "f7bc2e298d06e2c92a93c26a19f2a1b1", "scraped_at": "2025-12-10T16:45:32.586345", "updated_at": "2025-12-10T16:45:32.586354", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Nissan to strengthen product portfolio, advance electrification, introduce new ways of developing and manufacturing, and harness partnerships to achieve Ambition 2030 vision YOKOHAMA, Japan Nissan Motor Co., Ltd, today launched The Arc, its new business plan to drive value and strengthen competitiveness.
