On the one hand, it\u2019s a great development success story in terms of social indicators.

Moving forward, Sri Lanka should really pivot and focus on exports, green economy and sustainability. These are also important for the transshipment positioning of Sri Lanka,\u201d he added. Fakhoury said scaling up digital services, agri-business and specialised manufacturing should form part of the country\u2019s diversification push. He noted opportunities in high-value tourism segments and urged expanding destinations in the Northern and Eastern provinces. He said the IFC would prioritise responsible tourism, export-linked investments, decarbonisation in manufacturing, value-added production and healthcare and pharmaceuticals. The IFC, part of the World Bank Group, is among Sri Lanka\u2019s largest private-sector investors and one of the world\u2019s biggest development finance institutions.

From 2021 through June 2026, IFC commitments will total about US $ 1.6 billion in funded and unfunded instruments, he said, adding the institution is \u201cbullish\u201d on further investments. \u201cWe see great opportunities in financial inclusion to help scale up financing for MSMEs, especially women-owned or women-led ones,\u201d he said. He added that the IFC would continue to back sustainability and trade finance, capital market development and innovative instruments for real-sector growth. \u201cIn terms of infrastructure, we are very bullish on renewable energy, energy efficiency, mobility, ports and logistics and have full engagements under the World Bank group. Private-public partnerships will be critical, given the financing needs and the limitations of fiscal space,\u201d Fakhoury said, noting interest in new opportunities in telecommunications and logistics.

The approval covers Binance.com through three separately regulated entities in ADGM, an exchange, a clearing house and a broker-dealer, each granted distinct permissions to conduct trading, clearing, settlement, custody and over-the-counter activities. The companies, currently named Nest Services Limited, Nest Clearing and Custody Limited and BCI Limited, would be rebranded to reflect their new roles, Binance said. Nest Services has been authorised as a Recognised Investment Exchange to run a multilateral trading facility for spot and derivatives products, while Nest Clearing has been approved as a Recognised Clearing House with additional powers to provide custody and central securities depository services. BCI has been licensed as a broker-dealer with permissions spanning investment dealing, asset management, custody arrangements and money services. Binance said the \u201cglobal first\u201d provides regulatory clarity across multiple markets and strengthens the exchange\u2019s efforts to build a more compliant operating model. The company added that ADGM\u2019s regime, regarded by industry participants as a \u201cgold-standard\u201d framework, brings higher levels of oversight, operational resilience and consumer protection. \u201cThis reflects our commitment to compliance, transparency and user protection,\u201d Co-Chief Executive Richard Teng said, adding that the licence enhances the platform\u2019s legitimacy as it scales its institutional and retail offering.

The approval covers Binance.com through three separately regulated entities in ADGM, an exchange, a clearing house and a broker-dealer, each granted distinct permissions to conduct trading, clearing, settlement, custody and over-the-counter activities. The companies, currently named Nest Services Limited, Nest Clearing and Custody Limited and BCI Limited, would be rebranded to reflect their new roles, Binance said. Nest Services has been authorised as a Recognised Investment Exchange to run a multilateral trading facility for spot and derivatives products, while Nest Clearing has been approved as a Recognised Clearing House with additional powers to provide custody and central securities depository services. BCI has been licensed as a broker-dealer with permissions spanning investment dealing, asset management, custody arrangements and money services. Binance said the global first provides regulatory clarity across multiple markets and strengthens the exchanges efforts to build a more compliant operating model. The company added that ADGMs regime, regarded by industry participants as a gold-standard framework, brings higher levels of oversight, operational resilience and consumer protection. This reflects our commitment to compliance, transparency and user protection, Co-Chief Executive Richard Teng said, adding that the licence enhances the platforms legitimacy as it scales its institutional and retail offering.

The strategic shift was disclosed alongside the company\u2019s annual report for the 2024/25 financial year, where Odel reported a net loss of Rs.4.45 billion. Independent auditors Ernst & Young raised a red flag on the company\u2019s financial health, citing a \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d regarding its ability to continue as a going concern, due to the accumulated losses of Rs.12.7 billion and current liabilities exceeding the current assets by Rs.15.2 billion. In a major strategic shift concerning its mixed development project in Ward Place, Odel announced that the originally planned residential apartment component of Odel Mall will no longer proceed. The management has decided to repurpose the space allocated for apartments into rentable office space. The decision reflects a move to \u201cderisk\u201d the project, with the company noting that office space offers a more predictable revenue stream and lower development risks compared to the volatile residential market. The revised scope is also expected to reduce the overall funding requirement for the project, which currently carries a capital work-in-progress value of Rs.17.8 billion. To complete the construction of Odel Mall under this revised design, the company plans to raise Rs.4.5 billion in new funding. The financing strategy for the project has been updated to rely on advances from office space sales supplemented by external equity. This pivot is part of a wider remedial plan announced by Odel to address the negative working capital position that triggered its transfer to the Watch List. In addition to the mall completion, the plan includes adopting dynamic marketing strategies to boost footfall, closing the underperforming stores to reduce overheads and evaluating alternative financing sources. Crucially, the Softlogic group is actively seeking potential equity partners to infuse fresh capital into its retail sector, including the Odel group. On the debt front, the company is heavily leveraged, with total interest-bearing borrowings standing at Rs.20.77 billion as of March 31, 2025. A significant portion of this debt is tied to the Odel Mall project through a syndicated loan facility involving Hatton National Bank (HNB), Sampath Bank and Bank of Ceylon, with a balance of approximately Rs.8.2 billion. To manage this burden, Odel is actively renegotiating the debt repayment plans. The company revealed that the consortium of banks led by HNB has \u201cresponded positively\u201d and is currently evaluating the restructuring options for the syndicated loan and accrued interest. This restructuring is intended to align debt service commitments with the updated timeline of the mall project. Despite the financial strain, Odel\u2019s operational performance has shown signs of resilience. In the six months ended September 30, 2025, the group revenue grew to Rs.3.3 billion, up from Rs.2.7 billion in the same period the previous year. The company has also been aggressively rationalising its footprint, closing 17 underperforming outlets during the last financial year while opening new value-focused \u2018ODEL Brands Outlet Stores\u2019 to cater to the price-sensitive consumers.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Security manager at Taj Samudra arrested for assaulting trainees IPL 2026 Auction: 3 Sri Lankans among top INR 2 Crore picks Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now Taj Samudra terminates security officer following internal inquiry Rainfall expected to increase from Thursday DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Tilvin Silva\u2019s Encounter with the Tamil Diaspora in London Protests by a few sections had no impact BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days Govt. under fire for failure to mitigate disaster damage despite prior warnings      ", "content_hash": "bbea677581a5962c1a70d2597ef8fee1", "scraped_at": "2025-12-09T12:58:10.566241", "updated_at": "2025-12-09T12:58:10.566250", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online HitAd TimesJobs E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads WNL Home By Nishel Fernando Odel PLC has scrapped plans for luxury apartments at its flagship Odel Mall project in Ward Place, pivoting instead to office space as part of a broader remedial strategy to address severe financial headwinds that have seen the retailer placed on the Colombo Stock Exchanges Watch List.

The EDB is currently working closely with customs, port authorities, and logistics providers to manage infrastructure delays caused by adverse weather conditions and expedite export-related clearances. Special government attention has now been focused on assisting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in particular to rapidly reactivate their operational capacity during this recovery process. The discussion highlighted the growing intensity and frequency of climate-related challenges in recent times, underscoring the urgent need for proactive and sustainable responses.

Rising AI-enabled deception, ESG misrepresentation and crypto-related schemes signal the need for governance models tailored to the region\u2019s behavioural and technological realities. According to ACCA\u2019s new report, \u2018Combatting fraud in a perfect storm\u2019, organisations across Asia-Pacific are contending with a diverse and fast-evolving fraud landscape, shaped by procurement fraud (34 percent), bribery and corruption (20 percent), and growing blind spots in crypto fraud and ESG misrepresentation. Rapid innovation in digital payments and super-app platforms has expanded attack surfaces, with AI-enabled deception accelerating the speed and sophistication of fraud across the region. Cultural dynamics remain a defining factor. In many Asia-Pacific markets, openly discussing fraud is still perceived as disloyalty, and hierarchical norms discourage whistleblowing. Independence of investigators and clear protections against retaliation are therefore critical, particularly for junior staff, who reported the highest levels of concern. Drawing on responses from over 2,000 professionals and 31 roundtable discussions around the world, the study \u2013 launched during International Fraud Awareness Week \u2013 underscores the need to embed behavioural risk assessments and align fraud-prevention efforts with local cultural realities Regional survey results show reporting ease averaging 3.82/5, with junior staff the most concerned about retaliation, highlighting a persistent imbalance in power dynamics that restricts upward reporting. Respondents emphasised the importance of culturally attuned governance, transparency of process, and leadership-led accountability to build trust. In collaboration with ACFE, IIA, CISI, ISC2, Airmic and ACi, the report introduces a new Prevalence vs Materiality matrix lens to help organisations make better decisions about allocating resources before fraud diminishes them.

Rising AI-enabled deception, ESG misrepresentation and crypto-related schemes signal the need for governance models tailored to the regions behavioural and technological realities. According to ACCAs new report, Combatting fraud in a perfect storm, organisations across Asia-Pacific are contending with a diverse and fast-evolving fraud landscape, shaped by procurement fraud 34 percent, bribery and corruption 20 percent, and growing blind spots in crypto fraud and ESG misrepresentation. Rapid innovation in digital payments and super-app platforms has expanded attack surfaces, with AI-enabled deception accelerating the speed and sophistication of fraud across the region. Cultural dynamics remain a defining factor. In many Asia-Pacific markets, openly discussing fraud is still perceived as disloyalty, and hierarchical norms discourage whistleblowing. Independence of investigators and clear protections against retaliation are therefore critical, particularly for junior staff, who reported the highest levels of concern. Drawing on responses from over 2,000 professionals and 31 roundtable discussions around the world, the study  launched during International Fraud Awareness Week  underscores the need to embed behavioural risk assessments and align fraud-prevention efforts with local cultural realities Regional survey results show reporting ease averaging 3.825, with junior staff the most concerned about retaliation, highlighting a persistent imbalance in power dynamics that restricts upward reporting. Respondents emphasised the importance of culturally attuned governance, transparency of process, and leadership-led accountability to build trust. In collaboration with ACFE, IIA, CISI, ISC2, Airmic and ACi, the report introduces a new Prevalence vs Materiality matrix lens to help organisations make better decisions about allocating resources before fraud diminishes them. Through its companion Calls to Action and Thematic Typology, the report also provides new guidance on assessing what works and doesnt  and crucially how to incorporate behavioural insights into risk governance, moving fraud prevention from compliance theatre to operational reality.

Speaking to Mirror Business, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Buddhika Hewawasam revealed that the scheme is now expected to come into effect from January, following necessary legislative clearances. The move is seen as a critical step in revitalising the tourism sector, which is central to the country\u2019s economic stability and immediate post-disaster recovery efforts. Earlier, The Hotel Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President Asoka Hettigoda revealed that industry leaders had requested the immediate implementation of a visa-free regime during high-level discussions with the President, Treasury Secretary, and Tourism Minister. Outlining a critical action plan for post-Ditwah recovery, the industry had urged the President to utilise emergency powers to expedite this process and immediately expand the list of eligible countries to maximise arrivals during the critical recovery phase. However, Hewawasam highlighted complications in implementing this under emergency powers. Consequently, the government has decided to secure parliamentary approval to ensure the process is legally robust. In terms of extending the number of countries beyond the proposed 40, Hewawasam noted that the scheme will be reviewed every six months. He indicated that the government could extend the number of countries in six months depending on the outcome of the initial phase. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be seen as desperate,\u201d he remarked, emphasising the need for a strategic and dignified approach to attracting visitors. The initiative to open the borders visa-free to a wider pool of nations is not new, having faced significant headwinds since its inception. The proposal was first aggressively pushed forward last year, when the Cabinet approved visa-free entry for 35 countries in August 2024, later expanding the list to 38 countries with the intention of immediate implementation. However, the move was paralysed by a Supreme Court interim order suspending the controversial VFS Global visa outsourcing deal, which threw the country\u2019s immigration processing into disarray. Since then, the comprehensive visa-free facility has remained in limbo. Foreign and Tourism Minister Vijitha Herath previously noted that the delay in implementing the scheme for the additional countries was largely due to awaiting clearance from the Attorney General\u2019s (AG) Department to resolve the legal entanglements left behind by the suspended visa deal. At present, only holders of ordinary, diplomatic, official, or service passports from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, and Thailand are eligible for a free Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA).\u00a0\nCurrently, the visa-free facility is limited to nationals from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, and Thailand. Under the proposed January rollout, this list is expected to expand to 33 additional nations, covering major source markets including the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nThe scheme also aims to capture high-potential travelers from across Europe\u2014specifically Austria, Belarus, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Furthermore, the government intends to open the facility to key regional and Middle Eastern partners, including Bahrain, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, and the UAE.

These plans will primarily target new domestic investors, aiming to provide opportunities to raise capital and create pathways for investors to exit the market. According to CSE Chairman Dimuthu Abeysekera, this year has been successful for the CSE, with the market witnessing an improvement of approximately 40 percent since January. Since September 2024, it has increased by more than 100 percent. \u201cMost of our investors are located in the Western Province. We want to move out of the province. Right now, the stock exchange has ten branches outside of the CSE with brokers involved, but we intend to have a branch in each province,\u201d Abeysekera stated. Currently, Sri Lanka has more than 900,000 Central Depository System (CDS) accounts; however, according to Abeysekera, only about 50,000 of these are active. \u201cThat\u2019s not even 0.2 percent of the population. We want to increase the number of accounts initially up to about 100,000, and we have to set up a few plans to do so. One such plan is conducting awareness campaigns outside of Colombo,\u201d he noted, adding that many Sri Lankans remain unaware of the stock market, possessing knowledge only of banks and insurance companies. \u201cWhen interest rates are down and people deposit their money, they get only about six to seven percent interest. When they have no place to invest their money, due to a lack of awareness, they get caught by criminals who promise around ten to fifteen percent interest monthly. We want to fill the gap so there is another regulated entity for people to invest in,\u201d Abeysekera said. Abeysekera also highlighted the CSE\u2019s collaboration with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) outside of Colombo, aligning with the SEC\u2019s new initiative \u2018Samata Kotasak\u2019 (A share or unit for everyone). \u201cWe are also speaking to many companies and are receiving a lot of applications for bond issuances, such as blue bonds and green bonds. We also had around two new companies float in the market,\u201d Abeysekera said, adding that the CSE is also targeting the involvement of the SME sector and other industries in stock market activities. Regarding the CSE\u2019s overseas activities, Abeysekera noted that while there were around Rs. 9 billion in divestments last year, divestments reached approximately Rs. 48 billion by November this year due to the 40 percent market expansion. \u201cInvestors took advantage of the market expansion and cashed in on foreign funds because they need to show profits to their owners outside of Sri Lanka,\u201d he remarked. Abeysekera remains hopeful that stock market prices will increase next year, allowing the CSE to canvas overseas markets. He indicated that the CSE will target the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the next quarter, followed by Europe or the United States. He made these remarks on the second day of the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit 2025, organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC).

The company confirmed that shareholder approval has already been obtained for the proposed capital infusion, which is expected to materialise in the second half of the 2025/26 financial year. In addition to the negotiations with prospective strategic investors for an investment ranging between Rs. 3 billion and Rs. 4.4 billion, the company\u2019s existing shareholders are anticipated to inject approximately Rs. 1 billion. These funds are earmarked to support the company\u2019s subsidiaries, several of which were flagged in June 2025 for facing a \u201cserious loss of capital\u201d situation where net assets had fallen below stated capital. The capital raising efforts come as the group faces continued financial headwinds. According to interim financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2025, Hela reported a consolidated loss of Rs. 4.1 billion, widening from a loss of Rs. 2.98 billion in the same period the previous year. Group revenue for the six-month period also declined to Rs. 32.3 billion compared to Rs. 42.98 billion a year earlier, reflecting a challenging global operating environment. Despite the operational difficulties, the group has made significant progress in restructuring its debt profile. Hela announced the successful completion of a restructuring arrangement for Rs. 15.1 billion in bank borrowings during the first half of FY 2025/26. The revised terms convert these facilities into a nine-year term loan with a one-year grace period for principal repayment, carrying an interest rate of SOFR + 1 percent for the first two years. This follows a Rights Issue concluded in October 2024, which raised Rs. 1.6 billion to settle banking facilities for its subsidiary, Foundation Garments (Pvt) Ltd. The details of the group\u2019s recovery plan emerged alongside the release of its delayed Annual Report for 2024/25, following a notification from the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) on November 28, 2025, warning of a potential trading suspension if the report was not submitted by early December. The company\u2019s auditors had issued a disclaimer of opinion on the annual accounts, citing material uncertainties regarding the group\u2019s going concern status due to a net liability position and overdue payables, though the Board remains confident that the restructuring and capital injection will drive recovery. As of September 30, 2025, the company\u2019s shareholding structure was led by Lesing Hela Limited, which held a 48.43 percent stake, followed by Tars Investments Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. with a 15.15 percent holding.

REPA and other groups warned that this move could deter local investors and hinder the growth of the renewable energy sector. They emphasised the importance of energy supply for economic development and urged the Government to support sustainable energy initiatives. Darshana Liyanasekara, Chairman of REPA, highlighted the numerous benefits of renewable energy. He explained that generating and using sustainable energy aligns with global goals and fosters international cooperation. \u201cSolar power is highly feasible due to consistent sunlight and ample space for installation. It involves low investment and maintenance costs, minimal foreign exchange flow, and remains eco-friendly. The revenue stays within the country, boosting the local economy and creating jobs. Solar power supports the 2050 zero carbon energy goals, reduces production costs for local industries, and is crucial for meeting the 70 percent renewable energy target by 2030,\u201d he said. REPA Secretary Amal Sarathchandra addressed challenges in promoting solar energy. He noted that local investors are discouraged by unfair price revisions and delays in project approvals. \u201cTrust is further undermined by the suspension of new project contracts and inadequate support for existing installations,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial relief is hard to obtain, and the tax system imposes taxes on solar devices like panels and inverters.\u201d REPA Vice President Suresh Galanga emphasised the need to support local investors. He argued that while foreign investment offers temporary capital, it has long-term financial drawbacks, similar to foreign debt. \u201cMoney paid for electricity from foreign projects flows out of the country, much like diesel and coal expenditures,\u201d he said. \u201cEncouraging local investors through prioritised procurement guidelines and support is vital to revitalising the renewable energy sector.\u201d Chanaka Jayawardena, REPA\u2019s Treasurer said that boosting renewable energy generation, including solar power, would greatly benefit the country economically, given the high costs of fuel-based power generation. \u201cIn 2022 and 2023, Rs. 203.7 billion and Rs. 278.9 billion were spent on fuel-based power generation, respectively. This expenditure threatens the economy in both the short and long term. Installing 1,000 megawatts of solar power could add 1,320 gigawatt hours per year at a cost of Rs. 48.8 billion, while generating the same capacity with diesel would cost Rs. 92.4 billion.\u201d Electricity Consumers\u2019 Association President M.D.R.

The announcement made yesterday brings the much-needed financial support to industries and hotels. After having lobbied for lower electricity costs, the PUCSL\u2019s decision comes as a welcome change. Under the new tariff structure, hotels will be able to reap the benefit of a 26 percent reduction, while industries will see a 25.3 percent decrease. The overall reduction in electricity tariffs stands at 22.49 percent. The new rates are effective from today, July 16. The move is a notable shift from the series of tariff hikes imposed, which saw electricity costs soar by as much as 400 percent. The hike made it increasingly difficult for the industrial and tourism sectors to stay afloat. The tourism sector, which had managed to be categorised under the \u2018industry category\u2019 for electricity tariffs, after several episodes of tariff increases found itself paying exorbitant rates as it did when under the \u2018super-tariff\u2019 scheme. The private sector has been vocal about the overestimated tariff forecasts by the Ceylon Electricity Board, which led to unnecessarily high retail and industrial tariffs. However, their concerns did not receive much attention until now. Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel sector, a major contributor to the nation\u2019s export revenue, has repeatedly emphasised the need for a rigorous implementation of a least-cost generation plan. This, it argues, is essential for Sri Lanka to stay competitive, with the regions adopting low-cost generation and offering lower tariffs without subsidies. The sector also urged for power purchase agreements to be based on cutting-edge technology, with price discovery conducted through transparent competitive bidding. There is a strong call for policies that support the scaling up of renewable energy, including rooftop solar, in line with the government\u2019s goal of generating 70 percent of the country\u2019s energy from renewable sources by 2030. With increasing pressure from global brands for the decarbonisation of supply chains, Sri Lanka must move swiftly in adopting renewable energy solutions but at competitive prices, it said. 1 2 3 4 5  09 Dec 2025 47 minute ago 09 Dec 2025 51 minute ago 09 Dec 2025 2 hours ago 09 Dec 2025 2 hours ago 09 Dec 2025 2 hours ago General : +94 0115 335 731 +94 0112 304 545 Circulation : +94 0112 479 611 Advertising : +94 0112 479 561 Subscription : +94 0112 479 626 Technical : +94 011 538 3437 helpdesk@wijeya.lk All the content on this website is copyright protected and can be reproduced only by giving the due courtesy to 'dailymirror.lk' Copyright \u00a9 2004 Wijeya Newspapers Ltd.", "content_hash": "afbbb54b05373a81e2fb2ebd5718ba6e", "scraped_at": "2025-12-09T13:09:27.474456", "updated_at": "2025-12-09T13:09:27.474467", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Daily Mirror - Print Edition Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads Tue, 09 Dec 2025 Todays Paper 16 Jul 2024 - 981 Sri Lankas commercial sector can breathe a sigh of relief as the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka PUCSL approved the awaited reduction in electricity tariffs.

While southern resorts have been largely unaffected by the crisis, the problem areas are the hill country and the Northcentral Province. All tourist sites have been closed since Thursday while some travellers are considering postponing their visit plans. Some resort properties in Nuwara Eliya had been damaged while the rooms of a hotel in Kandy had been flooded forcing about 35 guests to be shifted to the bar area. At the moment tourist arrivals are being postponed without any further notice since accessibility to hotels (particularly to the hill country) have been blocked as roads are flooded, Nuwara Eliya Hotels Association former President Shaam Weerasooriya has said. But these postponements will not be subjected to any charges. Meanwhile, travellers already in the country on tour or just arrived have been taken to safe hotels and transit hotels. Mr. Weerasooriya said some travellers have been placed in hotels somewhere closer to Colombo like the transit hotels as these places are functioning well especially the city hotels. Transportation is also provided to these locations in which areas the roads are accessible. Some tourists have also been placed in hotels in Kandy that are currently full due to their inability to go further to hotels like in Nuwara Eliya. Hotels in Nuwara Eliya have been in touch with travel agents and tour guides to establish communication with their guests and ensure their safety while touring or visiting the country, Mr. Weerasooriya said.

By Sunimalee Dias Sri Lankas tourism industry has taken charge of ensuring the safety of tourists and is adhering to necessary precautions required and requested most arrivals to be postponed in the wake of the cyclonic storm Ditwah that hit the country on Thursday. While southern resorts have been largely unaffected by the crisis, the problem areas are the hill country and the Northcentral Province. All tourist sites have been closed since Thursday while some travellers are considering postponing their visit plans. Some resort properties in Nuwara Eliya had been damaged while the rooms of a hotel in Kandy had been flooded forcing about 35 guests to be shifted to the bar area. At the moment tourist arrivals are being postponed without any further notice since accessibility to hotels particularly to the hill country have been blocked as roads are flooded, Nuwara Eliya Hotels Association former President Shaam Weerasooriya has said. But these postponements will not be subjected to any charges. Meanwhile, travellers already in the country on tour or just arrived have been taken to safe hotels and transit hotels. Mr. Weerasooriya said some travellers have been placed in hotels somewhere closer to Colombo like the transit hotels as these places are functioning well especially the city hotels. Transportation is also provided to these locations in which areas the roads are accessible. Some tourists have also been placed in hotels in Kandy that are currently full due to their inability to go further to hotels like in Nuwara Eliya. Hotels in Nuwara Eliya have been in touch with travel agents and tour guides to establish communication with their guests and ensure their safety while touring or visiting the country, Mr. Weerasooriya said. He noted that the hotels are very safe and that the transportation systems are safe as well and a system to protect travelers when moving from one place to another.

The move, approved by Cabinet in November 11, comes after the Central Bank flagged serious concerns about the long-term survival of both institutions. Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe did not mince words this week when he described the two specialised lenders as \u201cburdened with unsustainable business models, poor profitability and an inability to meet minimum capital requirements\u201d. Speaking at a media briefing, he said the regulator had drawn up a \u201ctargeted consolidation plan\u201d focusing on smaller banks to safeguard financial sector stability and protect depositors. According to the plan, the government\u2019s entire shareholding in HDFC incorporated under the Housing Development Finance Corporation Act of 1997 will be transferred to Bank of Ceylon (BOC), which will operate HDFC as its subsidiary.\u00a0 The State Mortgage and Investment Bank, established in 1975, will become a subsidiary of People\u2019s Bank (PB) under a similar transfer of state-owned shares. Dr. Weerasinghe highlighted that both HDFC and SMIB had \u201clow risk densities due to their heavy reliance on Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF)-backed loans\u201d, which carry zero risk-weighting but also reflect the narrowness of their loan books. Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings, in its latest review, supported this view, noting that the proposed transfers are unlikely to affect the ratings of BOC or PB. Several financial and banking analysts fear that once absorbed into larger banks, low-income housing borrowers traditionally served by these institutions could be de-prioritised in favour of more commercially attractive segments.

Officials at the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) told The Sunday Times Business that they were able to control the spread of the disease by taking the right measures and cutting down the affected trees. It was noted that there was no medication or chemical that could be used to eradicate this disease that had affected some coconut trees in the Galle, Weligama and parts of Hambantota district. The only solution for the eradication of the disease was to cut down the tress and then destroy them where the insects are found. Officials note that no medical solution had been found anywhere else in the world either. It was pointed out that once these affected trees were cut down no new plants were allowed to be replanted for about the last seven years since the threat of the spread of the disease was high. During this time the CRI has ensured that the rest of the coconut plants are monitored by maintaining a radius of 3km where the disease is less prevalent. Within and outside this 3km border, areas are being monitored and as a result some areas have now been released for new replanting with a disease resistant variety. The resistant variety is produced by making a Green Dwarf coconut plant cross with a tall variety that is called CRIC 365. For the first time last year replanting commenced by the CRI. Another preventive measure adopted by the authorities was to not send the coconut plucked out of these areas outside of the region they were cultivated in a bid to control the spread of the disease to other parts of the country. Of the approximately 65 million coconut trees in the country only about 300,000 have been affected and cut down. Due to the constant monitoring carried out by the CRI the authorities in Sri Lanka have been able to control the spread of the disease to any other areas. The disease is still prevalent in these parts of the country and it continues to be monitored by the CRI.

He said that this rich tapestry of food would be an occasion to celebrate diversity. The suggestion came just as the government announced the Sri Lanka Day event to be held in December as a means of bridging the ethnic divide and celebrating Sri Lanka\u2019s multicultural societies. He is still waiting for a reply! That person was our young economist Ruwanputha . He called me on this Thursday morning to discuss the same topic, after reading about JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva, during a visit to London, inviting Sri Lankans to come home for the three-day festival from December 14 to 16 and celebrate the event\u2019s unity theme. \u201cI wrote to Sri Lanka Tourism many months ago to organise a food fiesta featuring the food of many communities for tourists and Sri Lankans, but sadly they didn\u2019t respond. Not even an acknowledgement of the email. This is the kind of public service that we have today. Here is an idea that they should take forward, as food is a great way to bring communities together, but sadly they didn\u2019t respond,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the problem in Sri Lanka\u2026..there is limited space in the public service for creativity and innovation. No one listens if you have a good idea. That happens only in the private sector,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe if I had proposed the idea to tourism industry associations it may have been taken on board,\u201d he said. Ruwanputha\u2019s suggestion was a simple one. December is the period when the country is filled with tourists (coming during the winter season) and also Sri Lankans resident abroad returning home for their annual year-end vacation and it is good to celebrate Sri Lanka Day with a food festival. The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said that the government was promoting Sri Lankan Day as a national platform to bring every community together. While the vision behind this event would be to create a space where all citizens can feel included and respected regardless of political, religious or cultural identity, it pointed out that it is \u201cimportant that opposition parties and civil society organisations are also included, so that the event reflects the full diversity of the country\u201d. While peace and reconciliation are considered the barometer of success of a society, one of the most forgotten aspects of culture and diversity is the colourful range of food of the different communities. Real peace and reconciliation has eluded Sri Lanka, despite efforts by many governments. One very easy aspect of bridging the ethnic divide is food and music. The diversity of food cuts across many cultural barriers. In fact in recent times, many tourists keen on learning the country\u2019s culture have visited villages and watched how food is prepared. In one step further in this process, they have also joined in the cooking, pounding ingredients in a stone mortar, preparing string hoppers and hoppers and other everyday food. Consider the rich variety of Sri Lankan food coming down the ages and influenced by our colonial masters. From the Sinhalese, you have Ambul Thiyal, a sour fish curry, Kaju Maluwa, a cashew curry, Kottu, a battered mixture of meat, vegetables and rotti made to the exciting sounds of the baila, Kiribath and Pol Sambola. From the Tamils come Appam and Indiappam (hoppers and string hoppers) from South India, Murukku, Pittu and Kiri Toffee, though some may argue that the latter is a food developed by the Sinhalese. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the food and its exquisite taste that matters, not from where it originated. The Malay community is famous for Dodol, Satay (fried beef) and Achcharu which comes from the Malay word Achar known as Malay pickle, while the Burghers celebrate their rich past with Lamprais, Rich Cake and Breudher. The small Borah community contribution is through Bombay sweets which includes Muskat. Then consider the variety of music and dances with baila, a Portuguese-origin musical song and dance form, taking pride of place. In fact, when the baila is played at family and public functions, guests let their hair down and join in the singing and dancing\u2026\u2026.communities get together and it\u2019s like time spent in the kindergarten where it didn\u2019t matter if your fellow student came from a different community. There was no class distinction or barriers on racial lines. Everyone was alike and teachers made sure everyone was treated equally. Food and music are great ways to overcome divisions and hostility among races and bring better results than speeches and special events heralding Sri Lanka\u2019s diversity.

Many months ago, a friend wrote to the Sri Lanka Tourism office in Colombo and suggested that the authorities should organise a food festival during the forthcoming Sri Lanka Day celebrations next month bringing in the diversity of food from different communities. He said that this rich tapestry of food would be an occasion to celebrate diversity. The suggestion came just as the government announced the Sri Lanka Day event to be held in December as a means of bridging the ethnic divide and celebrating Sri Lankas multicultural societies. He is still waiting for a reply! That person was our young economist Ruwanputha . He called me on this Thursday morning to discuss the same topic, after reading about JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva, during a visit to London, inviting Sri Lankans to come home for the three-day festival from December 14 to 16 and celebrate the events unity theme. I wrote to Sri Lanka Tourism many months ago to organise a food fiesta featuring the food of many communities for tourists and Sri Lankans, but sadly they didnt respond. Not even an acknowledgement of the email. This is the kind of public service that we have today. Here is an idea that they should take forward, as food is a great way to bring communities together, but sadly they didnt respond, he said. This is the problem in Sri Lanka..there is limited space in the public service for creativity and innovation. No one listens if you have a good idea. That happens only in the private sector, I said. Maybe if I had proposed the idea to tourism industry associations it may have been taken on board, he said. Ruwanputhas suggestion was a simple one. December is the period when the country is filled with tourists coming during the winter season and also Sri Lankans resident abroad returning home for their annual year-end vacation and it is good to celebrate Sri Lanka Day with a food festival. The National Peace Council NPC in a statement said that the government was promoting Sri Lankan Day as a national platform to bring every community together. While the vision behind this event would be to create a space where all citizens can feel included and respected regardless of political, religious or cultural identity, it pointed out that it is important that opposition parties and civil society organisations are also included, so that the event reflects the full diversity of the country. While peace and reconciliation are considered the barometer of success of a society, one of the most forgotten aspects of culture and diversity is the colourful range of food of the different communities. Real peace and reconciliation has eluded Sri Lanka, despite efforts by many governments. One very easy aspect of bridging the ethnic divide is food and music. The diversity of food cuts across many cultural barriers. In fact in recent times, many tourists keen on learning the countrys culture have visited villages and watched how food is prepared. In one step further in this process, they have also joined in the cooking, pounding ingredients in a stone mortar, preparing string hoppers and hoppers and other everyday food. Consider the rich variety of Sri Lankan food coming down the ages and influenced by our colonial masters. From the Sinhalese, you have Ambul Thiyal, a sour fish curry, Kaju Maluwa, a cashew curry, Kottu, a battered mixture of meat, vegetables and rotti made to the exciting sounds of the baila, Kiribath and Pol Sambola. From the Tamils come Appam and Indiappam hoppers and string hoppers from South India, Murukku, Pittu and Kiri Toffee, though some may argue that the latter is a food developed by the Sinhalese. Nevertheless, its the food and its exquisite taste that matters, not from where it originated. The Malay community is famous for Dodol, Satay fried beef and Achcharu which comes from the Malay word Achar known as Malay pickle, while the Burghers celebrate their rich past with Lamprais, Rich Cake and Breudher. The small Borah community contribution is through Bombay sweets which includes Muskat. Then consider the variety of music and dances with baila, a Portuguese-origin musical song and dance form, taking pride of place. In fact, when the baila is played at family and public functions, guests let their hair down and join in the singing and dancing.communities get together and its like time spent in the kindergarten where it didnt matter if your fellow student came from a different community. There was no class distinction or barriers on racial lines. Everyone was alike and teachers made sure everyone was treated equally. Food and music are great ways to overcome divisions and hostility among races and bring better results than speeches and special events heralding Sri Lankas diversity. Consider a band like the Gypsies and its late, legendary leader Sunil Perera. He would have been the ideal ambassador of peace. His iconic song Piti Kotapan None is a staple offering at many functions and weddings. Music and food indeed bring the world together and what better place than Sri Lanka where you enjoy a shot of arrack among friends with a variety of side dishes as bites.

While these plans are still at a nascent stage, expansion outside the country is definitely on the cards in the next five to 10 years, officials said, responding to a question by The Sunday Times Business at a media event hosted by the company recently. They said that the company is quite optimistic about the current market and is geared to cater to all the segments while being bullish on opening branches and expanding island-wide. Laksanda Gunawardena, CEO of MI Finance, stated that the company has opened 43 branches over the past 18 months. \u201cBy the end of this financial year, we hope to bring our branch network to 91,\u201d he said. The plan is to move out of Colombo to more rural areas, he added. He said that the opening up of the vehicle market has boosted the company\u2019s financial position. \u201cThe loan book growth and the growth in the asset base of the company have helped its financials,\u201d he added. MI Finance reported a 34 per cent rise in profit before tax to 837 million. Its lending portfolio increased from Rs. 37 billion to Rs. 75 billion, with loans comprising 35 per cent of this portfolio. Gold pawning was at 16 per cent of the loan portfolio at Rs. 12 billion as of 31st March. In an industry average of 8 per cent non-performing loan ratio, the company is maintaining a 2.8 per cent net average. Net interest income rose 24 per cent to Rs 3.4 billion, propelled by a 27 per cent increase in core book revenue and strategic repricing that lowered funding costs. The profitability surge was achieved alongside robust 40 per cent annualised growth in deposits, mobilised through the company\u2019s expanded network of 85 branches, Mr. Gunawardana added. He also noted that MI Finance is extremely positive about the Secure Transaction Registry recently launched by the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB). The company is in discussion with CRIB to onboard this platform, he added.

The loan book growth and the growth in the asset base of the company have helped its financials, he added. MI Finance reported a 34 per cent rise in profit before tax to 837 million. Its lending portfolio increased from Rs. 37 billion to Rs. 75 billion, with loans comprising 35 per cent of this portfolio. Gold pawning was at 16 per cent of the loan portfolio at Rs. 12 billion as of 31st March. In an industry average of 8 per cent non-performing loan ratio, the company is maintaining a 2.8 per cent net average. Net interest income rose 24 per cent to Rs 3.4 billion, propelled by a 27 per cent increase in core book revenue and strategic repricing that lowered funding costs. The profitability surge was achieved alongside robust 40 per cent annualised growth in deposits, mobilised through the companys expanded network of 85 branches, Mr. Gunawardana added. He also noted that MI Finance is extremely positive about the Secure Transaction Registry recently launched by the Credit Information Bureau CRIB. The company is in discussion with CRIB to onboard this platform, he added.

This year\u2019s celebrations are especially significant as they coincide with FAO\u2019s 80th anniversary, eight decades dedicated to support sustainable fisheries, food security, and coastal livelihoods worldwide.

Observed globally on November 21, World Fisheries Day recognises the importance of sustainable fisheries for food security, livelihoods and economic growth. It calls attention to the need for responsible management of aquatic resources, better working conditions for fishers, and greater recognition of their role in local and global aquatic food systems.

While Capital Metals PLC positions the project as a world-class resource development with transformative economic potential, newly detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) findings reveal a more complex, high-stakes picture along the island\u2019s fragile eastern coastline. The project\u2019s potential and favourable economics were highlighted at a recent promotional event hosted by the Sri Lankan High Commission in London. Officials emphasised improving macroeconomic indicators, policy reforms and an upcoming Investment Protection Act aimed at strengthening investor confidence. Capital Metals\u2019 phased development strategy keeps upfront capital low. An initial US$25 million investment is expected to generate $35-40 million in annual revenue at sub-$20 million operating costs. The total project requires $80 million, and despite higher taxes and royalties introduced in Sri Lanka, updated modelling shows a strong Net Present Value of $180 million. Local partnerships are central to navigating regulatory complexities. Ambeon Capital\u2019s $4 million investment for a 20 per cent stake has strengthened the company\u2019s domestic presence. The firm currently holds the only mineral-sands mining licence in the country and awaits two further approvals-licence expansion and export clearance. With first production targeted for early 2027, Capital Metals argues that the Taprobane project represents a rare opportunity: a high-grade, low-cost, strategically located mineral asset trading at a market value well below its economic potential. The project is located on the Akkaraipattu-Komari coastal belt in the Ampara District, Eastern Province, close to the towns of Pottuvil and Akkaraipattu. This 50-300 metre-wide stretch of beach known for its rich deposits of ilmenite, rutile, zircon, garnet and sillimanite has been divided into five sections: Tampaddai, Thirukkovil, Mulliadi, Omari and Sangamankanda. The total recoverable heavy mineral content is estimated at 5.43 million tonnes, making it one of the highest-grade undeveloped deposits globally. However, the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for the proposed mining operation offers a measured warning while granting overall clearance and concluding that the project\u2019s economic benefits outweigh environmental costs. The assessment identifies significant ecological risks. Two rare plant species, five endemic species and 12 nationally threatened plants have been recorded on the sand dunes set to undergo mining. The report states that disturbing such habitats will have \u201cmajor impacts on the ecology and biodiversity of the area\u201d. Although lagoons and mangroves fall outside the direct mining zone, the EIA warns of indirect disturbances to wildlife due to dust, noise and vibration. Strict mitigatory measures, continuous monitoring and early-warning systems have been recommended to prevent long-term ecological harm.

The bank\u2019s Development Credit Department, together with its Kaduruwela Branch, recently hosted the inaugural awareness programme titled \u201cEnhancing Paddy Productivity and Farmer Livelihoods through Adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and High-Tech Agriculture in the Polonnaruwa District\u201d, the bank said in a media release Held at the Agbo Hotel, Giritale, the event brought together more than 120 farmers from eight divisional areas, representing the district\u2019s diverse agricultural communities. This initiative is part of Commercial Bank\u2019s broader vision to drive national food security, empower the rural economy, and support farmers through knowledge-sharing and sustainable agricultural solutions that foster long-term economic resilience. While Polonnaruwa\u2019s average yield currently stands at around 4.5 metric tonnes per hectare, agricultural experts estimate the potential yield at approximately six metric tonnes. To help bridge this gap, the programme focused on creating awareness about modern cultivation methods, responsible use of agro-chemicals, mechanisation, financial management, and environmental sustainability. The bank said the initiative aims to position Polonnaruwa as a model district for sustainable, GAP-based paddy cultivation. It also seeks to promote financial inclusion among rural communities by connecting farmers with formal banking channels and customised financial solutions to fund mechanisation, crop diversification, and value-added processing.

This move will bring a large number of small retailers into the tax net and ultimately pass the 18 per cent VAT burden onto consumers. It will also create an imbalance in the economy, as most consumers will shift their purchases toward goods and services provided by businesses that are not liable for VAT. At a time when people are already struggling with the rising cost of living, this will be yet another blow to both small enterprises and the wider population,\u201d asserted Mahendra Perera, President of the Ceylon Federation of MSME, adding that many shops and small businesses will be trapped in this financial dilemma. Speakers at the event: Mr. Mahendra Perera (left) and Mr. G. K. Sudath Kumar. Pic by M.A.Pushpa Kumara. He was speaking at the Sunday Times Business Club (STBC)\u2019s bi-monthly meeting on Tuesday which focused on the \u2018collapse of small Sri Lankan businesses\u2019 owing to the Easter Sunday attack, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. The host hotel of the meeting is Shangri-La and the sponsor of the club is NDB Bank. He said like in many other countries, the MSME sector is the backbone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. MSMEs contribute 52 per cent to the national GDP and provide employment to 4.5 million people in the workforce. Quoting 2022 data from the Department of Census and Statistics, he said out of 1.3 million MSMEs, 263,000 have permanently closed, 14,577 are temporarily closed, and approximately 1,050,000 remain active. This data represents the situation up to 2022; however, the major impacts of the economic crisis was felt most strongly in 2023\u20132024. \u201cTherefore, we believe that an additional 100,000 or more enterprises have already been affected due to the bankruptcy declaration and the sharp rise in interest rates,\u201d he added. Mr. Perera said while parate execution was temporarily suspended, the extension ended in March 2025 and now a large number of MSME assets are already in the process of being auctioned. The Parate Act, which dates back to 1990, urgently needs to be amended to reflect current economic realities. Although the present government issued two circulars in December 2024 and January 2025, these have failed to address the core issues faced by MSMEs, pointing out that even though Rs. 50 billion was allocated for the MSME sector in the 2026 Budget, more than 60 per cent of MSMEs are listed in CRIB with Non-Performing Loan (NPL) status, making access to capital finance extremely difficult. The second speaker at the event, liquidator expert G. K. Sudath Kumar, Partner \u2013 Nanayakkara & Company, detailed out the various options offered to bankrupt firms via the process of an administrator or, if that doesn\u2019t work, liquidation. He said many companies are going into liquidation, and faced with the growing number of cases, one of the commercial high courts has been set aside purely for liquidation cases. When a company is unable to pay its debt, the directors of the company seek court permission to either wind up the company or declare bankruptcy. An administrator is then appointed, as a first step, to see whether the company can be revived after speaking to all creditors and debtors on restructuring due payments and restructuring the debt. In some cases, resuscitation succeeds, in some cases it won\u2019t. It\u2019s a fine balancing act by the administrator, he pointed out adding that in the Sri Lanka case, many people don\u2019t trust an administrator and this is an issue.

The Parate Act, which dates back to 1990, urgently needs to be amended to reflect current economic realities. Although the present government issued two circulars in December 2024 and January 2025, these have failed to address the core issues faced by MSMEs, pointing out that even though Rs. 50 billion was allocated for the MSME sector in the 2026 Budget, more than 60 per cent of MSMEs are listed in CRIB with Non-Performing Loan NPL status, making access to capital finance extremely difficult. The second speaker at the event, liquidator expert G. K. Sudath Kumar, Partner  Nanayakkara  Company, detailed out the various options offered to bankrupt firms via the process of an administrator or, if that doesnt work, liquidation. He said many companies are going into liquidation, and faced with the growing number of cases, one of the commercial high courts has been set aside purely for liquidation cases. When a company is unable to pay its debt, the directors of the company seek court permission to either wind up the company or declare bankruptcy. An administrator is then appointed, as a first step, to see whether the company can be revived after speaking to all creditors and debtors on restructuring due payments and restructuring the debt. In some cases, resuscitation succeeds, in some cases it wont. Its a fine balancing act by the administrator, he pointed out adding that in the Sri Lanka case, many people dont trust an administrator and this is an issue.

The bank said in a media release that its standalone post-tax profit stood at Rs. 28.8 billion, marking the highest nine-month profit in its history. With seven out of 10 Sri Lankans banking with People\u2019s Bank and one out of every five retail and business loans in the country originating from the bank, this exceptional performance reinforces its position as the most trusted and influential financial services provider in Sri Lanka, it said. Operating income stood at Rs. 121.9 billion, a substantial 99.4 per cent increase, supported by exceptional core earnings. Net interest income nearly doubled to Rs. 103.9 billion, driven by effective asset\u2013liability repricing amid changing market conditions, resulting in an improvement of the bank\u2019s net interest margin to 4 per cent, compared to 3.4 per cent in December 2024. The bank also recorded its highest-ever net fees and commissions for the period, reaching Rs. 12.2 billion, reflecting strong customer activity and strengthened transactional volumes. While the bank\u2019s solo results formed the foundation of its record performance, the group\u2019s consolidated results also remained strong. Consolidated post-tax profit reached Rs. 30.5 billion, with operating income amounting to Rs. 139.5 billion, an 85 per cent growth over the previous year.

What began as government policy rooted in environmental concerns has now created a widening economic gap one that industry stakeholders warn could take years to repair without urgent government intervention, industry stakeholders said Since the CPO import ban came into effect in April 2021, Sri Lanka has spent over US$175 million importing edible oils to meet domestic demand-an expense the country can ill afford amid its ongoing balance-of-payments pressures. Although a functioning oil-palm industry once supplied part of the almost-264,000 metric tonnes consumed annually domestically, the nation continues to depend nearly wholly on imports The fallout has been especially severe for Board of Investment (BOI) enterprises that relied on CPO as a key raw material for exports. These manufacturers once regular suppliers of hydrogenated palm-oil products such as vanaspathi ghee, bakery shortening, CBS fats and chocolate fats have collectively incurred losses estimated at $40 million. Their export pipelines collapsed after access to CPO was cut off in 2022, despite preferential market access under the Indo\u2013Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA). Ironically, India Sri Lanka\u2019s largest trading partner has recently reopened the same HS codes for palm-oil-based imports, while simultaneously increasing its own edible-oil tariffs. The result is a surge in demand for Sri Lankan processed palm-oil exports, but domestic producers remain paralysed without access to CPO. Industry representatives, in a detailed submission to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, have called for an immediate policy reset. They seek approval for BOI-registered companies to import CPO (HS Code 1511.10) through a tightly regulated licensing mechanism. Such a step, they argue, would restore export production, support domestic edible-oil supply chains, and generate an estimated $75 million annually in new export revenue. The appeal goes beyond short-term import relief. Plantation companies are also urging the government to lift the nationwide prohibition on new oil-palm cultivation a ban introduced in 2022 that abruptly halted a sector specifically developed to reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s edible-oil deficit. They propose a structured replanting programme of 10,000 acres annually, projecting that the country could achieve edible-oil self-sufficiency and even generate an export surplus within six years. Their argument is rooted in regional trends. India, which imports nearly eight million tonnes of palm oil annually, has already launched a massive programme to cultivate oil palm on five million hectares-a signal that palm cultivation, when regulated, is strategically valuable for food security. As Sri Lanka prepares for its 2026 shift from the Special Commodity Levy to a more predictable ad valorem tax structure for imported oils, one question lingers on: will policy reform come soon enough? The answer might mean life or death for manufacturers, plantation workers, and rural communities whose livelihoods depend on the sector.

Organisations can start with enterprise AI gradually, focusing on incremental use cases that drive efficiency and innovation without requiring major budgets or disruptive system changes. Yet, this promise is interwoven with nuances and intricacies that boards must navigate with discernment. The mandate is not to stifle adoption but to enable it responsibly, embedding AI within a governance architecture that harmonises ambition with accountability. AI is revolutionising how leaders and teams manage complexity, but its power must be guided responsibly. Board members can receive concise summaries of lengthy board papers before meetings, saving hours of preparation, while CEOs leverage AI to draft strategic briefs or scenario analyses in minutes. CFOs gain rapid financial insights, company secretaries can turn meeting transcripts into accurate minutes, and auditors accelerate risk reviews with AI-assisted checks. Sales teams prioritise leads, and call centre managers analyse customer sentiment instantly. These capabilities are real and accessible today, but they demand human-in-the-loop oversight, especially as organisations experiment with automated decision-making in areas like credit approvals, recruitment screening, and compliance alerts. Boards must ensure these systems remain transparent, explainable, and subject to human override to prevent bias, errors, and regulatory breaches. Achieving this balance calls for a truly cross-functional approach, aligned with the organisation\u2019s defined and regularly revisited risk appetite and tolerance levels. Boards set the strategic vision and provide oversight, while ICT and data teams build secure, scalable systems. Compliance and legal functions ensure regulations and contracts are met, risk managers anticipate and mitigate emerging threats within acceptable boundaries, and both internal and external audit update their programmes to include algorithm audits, data governance checks, bias and fairness testing, explainability reviews, cybersecurity controls, and assurance that human-in-the-loop oversight is maintained. Agile practices must also be embedded to adapt quickly to regulatory changes and emerging risks. Together, these roles create a unified governance framework that turns AI into a responsibly managed strategic asset driving innovation while staying within agreed risk parameters. AI exists across a spectrum of capability. At the foundational level is \u2018Narrow AI\u2019, systems built for a single purpose, such as Siri or Alexa handling voice commands, Netflix\u2019s recommendation engine tailoring content, or spam filters protecting email inboxes. A step further is \u2018Advanced Narrow AI\u2019, which remains domain-specific but demonstrates remarkable sophistication. Examples include ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Perplexity AI, China\u2019s ERNIE Bot, and DeepSeek. These systems can generate text, summarize documents, translate languages, assist with coding; enable computer vision for autonomous vehicles; and power scientific tools like AlphaFold for protein structure prediction. Beyond these practical applications lies \u2018General AI (AGI)\u2019, still hypothetical, which would mirror human cognitive flexibility, an AI capable of designing buildings, managing finances, and learning new skills without retraining. Some multi-modal AI systems (combining text, image, audio, and video) and agent-based architectures are moving toward AGI-like behaviour, but they remain domain-constrained. The ultimate frontier is \u2018Super AI\u2019 (ASI, with even post-ASI possibilities), a theoretical stage where machines surpass human intelligence entirely, a theoretical stage where machines surpass human intelligence entirely, innovating and governing at scales beyond human comprehension. While AGI and ASI remain aspirational, Narrow and Advanced Narrow AI are already transforming corporate operations, regulatory compliance, and government service delivery, bringing both unprecedented opportunities and governance challenges that demand immediate board-level attention. The EU AI Act, along with emerging national laws, OECD principles, and country-level AI strategies, is shaping a global regulatory landscape for responsible AI adoption. Together, these frameworks create a compliance environment that demands proactive data governance, AI inventorying, risk classification, vendor oversight, explainability, and robust accountability processes well before fully automated systems are deployed.

The unveiling signals the completion of Unity Plaza\u2019s ambitious redevelopment journey that began with its relaunch in November 2023.

He noted that while Sri Lanka went through a prolonged period of turbulence between 2018 and 2023, the country now stands out for having regained both political and economic stability; conditions he described as the most critical prerequisites for sustained investor interest. Desai said he increased the Fund\u2019s allocation to Sri Lanka soon after visiting the country in November 2022, at what he noted as the \u201cbottom\u201d of the crisis. \u201cValuations at that time were among the cheapest in the region, with the market trading at roughly four times forward earnings,\u201d he said, adding that, since then, the AFC Asia Frontier Fund has made Sri Lanka its second-largest country allocation, benefitting from both rising prices and a deliberate increase in exposure due to improving macro fundamentals. \u201cFor the first time in many years, Sri Lanka has both economic and political stability. The platform is set for stable growth over the next three to four years, provided this stability holds,\u201d he stressed. He acknowledged the recent natural disaster as a temporary setback, but insisted markets are forward-looking and Sri Lanka has already faced and recovered from worse shocks in recent years. Desai argued that despite a strong 2.5-year market recovery, Sri Lankan equities remain undervalued relative to their fundamentals and regional peers. The broader market trades at around 11 times earnings, below the 14-16 times price-to-earnings ratio seen in 2014-2016, when foreign investor presence was far stronger. \u201cCompany fundamentals, however, have largely returned to pre-crisis strength. Earnings growth is robust across the banking, consumer, and industrial sectors, return on equity levels have normalised, and private sector banks are benefitting directly from improved credit growth and macro stability,\u201d he pointed out. He compared Commercial Bank of Ceylon with Vietnam\u2019s largest commercial bank Vietcom Bank to illustrate the valuation gap. \u201cCommercial Bank trades at around one-time book value, while the comparable Vietnamese bank trades at nearly 2.5 times, yet Sri Lankan banks show stronger earnings momentum.\u201d In consumer markets too, Desai said companies such as Sunshine Holdings demonstrate earnings strength comparable to leading regional consumer giants but still trade at modest multiples. Although foreign participation in the Colombo Stock Exchange remains sharply lower than a decade ago\u2014now between 5% and 10% of daily turnover compared to nearly 50% in some years before 2018\u2014Desai noted this is part of a global trend, not just a Sri Lankan issue, with investors shifting towards US markets as the S&P 500 and major tech stocks delivered exceptional returns over the past decade. However, he believes foreign interest could return as macro fundamentals strengthen and stability persists. \u201cIf not in 2025, then by 2026 or 2027, you could see foreign funds coming back,\u201d he expressed confidence. He also emphasised that Sri Lanka cannot rely solely on foreign capital and must deepen domestic investor participation, which remains low. Only 11\u201312% of unit trust assets under management are in equities, far below levels seen in India or Vietnam. Desai highlighted several long-term strengths that continue to position Sri Lanka favourably. \u201cStrong corporate governance and transparency, making company access and information far easier than in many frontier markets; resilient pool of well-run companies with strong brands and decades of operational history; and untapped structural sectors, including logistics and tourism, where arrivals of 2.2\u20132.3 million remain far below regional comparators such as Cambodia,\u201d he explained. He also pointed out that Sri Lanka\u2019s market-cap-to-GDP ratio of roughly 25% is low relative to countries with more developed capital markets, suggesting significant room for expansion as equity participation deepens. Desai said Sri Lanka will remain a high-conviction market for the AFC Asia Frontier Fund for the next several years. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my top country picks. We\u2019ve been right about Sri Lanka for the past 2.5 years, and I remain very positive for the next two to three years. From here, it\u2019s up to the country not to drop the ball,\u201d he added. With stability restored, earnings strong, and valuations still attractive, he reiterated that Sri Lanka is well-positioned to deliver continued market outperformance, provided reforms stay on track and confidence remains intact.

He compared Commercial Bank of Ceylon with Vietnams largest commercial bank Vietcom Bank to illustrate the valuation gap. Commercial Bank trades at around one-time book value, while the comparable Vietnamese bank trades at nearly 2.5 times, yet Sri Lankan banks show stronger earnings momentum. In consumer markets too, Desai said companies such as Sunshine Holdings demonstrate earnings strength comparable to leading regional consumer giants but still trade at modest multiples. Although foreign participation in the Colombo Stock Exchange remains sharply lower than a decade agonow between 5 and 10 of daily turnover compared to nearly 50 in some years before 2018Desai noted this is part of a global trend, not just a Sri Lankan issue, with investors shifting towards US markets as the SP 500 and major tech stocks delivered exceptional returns over the past decade. However, he believes foreign interest could return as macro fundamentals strengthen and stability persists. If not in 2025, then by 2026 or 2027, you could see foreign funds coming back, he expressed confidence. He also emphasised that Sri Lanka cannot rely solely on foreign capital and must deepen domestic investor participation, which remains low. Only 1112 of unit trust assets under management are in equities, far below levels seen in India or Vietnam. Desai highlighted several long-term strengths that continue to position Sri Lanka favourably. Strong corporate governance and transparency, making company access and information far easier than in many frontier markets resilient pool of well-run companies with strong brands and decades of operational history and untapped structural sectors, including logistics and tourism, where arrivals of 2.22.3 million remain far below regional comparators such as Cambodia, he explained. He also pointed out that Sri Lankas market-cap-to-GDP ratio of roughly 25 is low relative to countries with more developed capital markets, suggesting significant room for expansion as equity participation deepens. Desai said Sri Lanka will remain a high-conviction market for the AFC Asia Frontier Fund for the next several years. Its one of my top country picks. Weve been right about Sri Lanka for the past 2.5 years, and I remain very positive for the next two to three years. From here, its up to the country not to drop the ball, he added. With stability restored, earnings strong, and valuations still attractive, he reiterated that Sri Lanka is well-positioned to deliver continued market outperformance, provided reforms stay on track and confidence remains intact.

Vimalenthirarajah\u00a0\u2013 Pic by Upul Abayasekara By Charumini de Silva The Trade, Commerce and Food Security Ministry is preparing to introduce a comprehensive national tariff policy by mid-2026, replacing what officials described as decades of \u201cpatchwork, sector-specific, and discriminatory\u201d protection that has suppressed competitiveness, discouraged entrepreneurship, and hindered integration into global value chains. Ministry Secretary K.A. Vimalenthirarajah speaking during a panel discussion at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday said the overhaul will mark a decisive shift away from a revenue-driven, protectionist tariff structure towards a transparent, predictable, and facilitative regime aligned with global trade norms. He stressed that the existing system, identified by the World Bank as one of the most complex in the world, has created unpredictability, high production costs, and limited the ability of local industries to compete regionally. He said the Government has now identified 10 core objectives and principles for the new policy, with four central pillars guiding the reform. The first is establishing predictability and consistency in the tariff regime, addressing longstanding complaints of ad-hoc changes and opaque decision-making. The second is simplification, with the new system designed to dramatically reduce complexity and remove the maze of para-tariffs and overlapping duties. The third is a shift from protection to \u201ctime-bound facilitation,\u201d ensuring that any support extended to infant industries is targeted, transparent, and temporary. The fourth is enabling global and regional value chain participation by lowering input costs and ensuring timely access to raw materials, intermediate goods, and capital goods. \u201cTariffs cannot be the panacea for every problem. For decades, they have distorted our entrepreneurship ecosystem,\u201d Vimalenthirarajah said, adding that the current structure has discouraged new entrants while forcing existing firms to rely on protection instead of productivity and innovation. He noted that the new regime will help transform Sri Lanka\u2019s inward-looking Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) into export-oriented enterprises and strengthen diversification efforts outlined by the Export Development Board (EDB). \u201cThe Cabinet has already approved the establishment of a National Tariff Committee and a Ministerial Tariff Committee, both of which are working towards finalising the new framework,\u201d he said. According to Vimalenthirarajah, the entire system is expected to be operational by the middle of next year, marking one of the most significant trade reforms in recent decades. He also underscored that the tariff overhaul is inseparable from Sri Lanka\u2019s broader trade agenda, particularly ongoing reviews of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and the country\u2019s renewed push to expand market access. \u201cA Cabinet-appointed committee is currently reassessing existing FTAs to develop a technically sound national strategy, including diversification into Asian, African, and Middle Eastern markets,\u201d he added. He also confirmed that Sri Lanka has received an invitation to join the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) following earlier requests, a move the Government is evaluating against long-term strategic interests. The Secretary emphasised that FTAs must be understood correctly: tariff reductions take place in staged phases, often over 15 to 20 years, and require extensive compliance with rules of origin, Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) protocols, and other regulatory standards. Vimalenthirarajah warned that misconceptions have slowed national progress, even though Sri Lanka benefits from multiple concessionary market access schemes that remain underutilised due to limited export depth. Responding to questions on using mineral resources in negotiations and addressing non-tariff barriers, he noted that Sri Lanka is stepping up engagement with the US and other partners to reduce such obstacles. He said global tariff averages are falling, making non-tariff barriers increasingly influential in determining competitiveness. As part of its reforms, Sri Lanka will accelerate the implementation of World Trade Organisation (WTO)-aligned protocols, aiming to complete the remaining 14 intellectual property-related agreements within three years. He added that the Single Window project and broader trade facilitation reforms will address bottlenecks in Customs approvals and compliance, ensuring Sri Lanka becomes a \u201ccompliant, predictable, and investment-friendly\u201d economy. Stating that Sri Lanka \u201ccannot afford to stand alone,\u201d Vimalenthirarajah said the Government is committed to regional integration and will pursue FTAs and economic partnerships that support investment flows, diversification, and export growth.

Speaking during a panel discussion at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce last week, Aluwihare outlined the project\u2019s evolution, highlighting China Harbour Engineering Company\u2019s (CHEC) three-decade presence in the country and the shift from engineering contracting into long-term urban development. \u201cOur journey is similar to Axiata\u2019s, CHEC has been in this country for 30 years. Initially we were doing roads, bridges and ports. With Port City, we really migrated up the value chain to become a developer,\u201d he said. He noted that the original concept was a large-scale reclaimed land project intended as a premium waterfront real estate development. However, during reclamation, the Government and project company decided to reposition it as Sri Lanka\u2019s long-missing services export zone. \u201cAs many of you know, close to 60% of Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP is services. But we still did not have a dedicated services export zone. Therefore, the idea was conceived that the Port City can be a special economic zone for export of services,\u201d Aluwihare said. He said CHEC has invested $ 1.3 billion to date in reclamation and infrastructure, with a further $ 250 million planned for phase two. \u201cWhat I would like to say is that we are now ready for business,\u201d he added. According to Aluwihare, Port City Colombo has already secured investors for six plots of land, with a total committed value of around $ 1.3 billion. Discussions are underway with about six more potential investors, and he expects these to translate into an additional $ 600\u2013850 million over the next three to four years, depending on macroeconomic stability. \u201cAs a company that has been in the country for 30 years, we are very optimistic about the potential. When we sell the Sri Lankan story overseas, what we are really trying to sell is potential. And in that story, what we try to address is the risk,\u201d he said. Aluwihare said that attracting investors requires incentives that compensate for Sri Lanka\u2019s weaker competitiveness rankings. \u201cThere are varying counterviews about providing tax holidays, especially under an IMF program tax holidays are considered taboo. But the question is, when other doing-business indicators are not competitive, what incentives do we need to attract investors?\u201d he asked. He confirmed that Port City successfully negotiated a fiscal package with the Government and the IMF, including a 10\u201315-year corporate income tax holiday, duty-free importation during project construction and exemptions from border taxes. \u201cThese should result in savings of about 20\u201325% in construction costs. Once operations start, investors will have a 10- to 15-year tax holiday,\u201d he said. However, he emphasised that the most important incentives are non-fiscal those designed to reduce foreign investor risk, particularly currency exposure. \u201cThe largest risk is foreign currency risk, especially in real estate development. Within Port City, the Sri Lankan rupee is not legal tender. It\u2019s a complete hedge against currency risk. There are 16 designated currencies you can invest and transact in,\u201d Aluwihare said. He added that Port City provides full capital mobility, a major deviation from South Asia\u2019s typically tight capital controls. \u201cSome of these restrictive capital controls that apply in the rest of South Asia do not apply in Port City,\u201d he noted, adding that companies can employ 100% foreign staff, who are eligible for long-term visas. He affirmed a single-window investment facilitation system is also in place to streamline approvals. Aluwihare acknowledged that early-stage implementation challenges persist. \u201cThere are certain initial teething problems, but these are currently being fixed. As we speak, we have 155 companies operating under Port City licences outside Port City, until the infrastructure is ready, and the total utilised space is close to 500,000 square feet,\u201d he added He added that the project\u2019s early traction has also given \u201ca much-needed boost to the real estate sector in Colombo,\u201d signalling rising investor confidence as the special economic zone approaches full operational readiness.

Speaking at a panel discussion at the \u2018Investment Pulse \u2013 Why Sri Lanka: Investor View\u2019 session of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, he said they, however, remain on track for next year\u2019s target of $ 20 billion. Over the past 10 months, total exports in both merchandise and services exports amounted to $ 14.4 billion, reflecting a 6% growth rate, which the EDB Chief described as a significant uptick compared with the past decade and signalling a positive trend despite structural vulnerabilities. He noted that the EDB has set out an ambitious agenda to reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s longstanding dependence on traditional commodities and apparel, aiming to raise the export sector\u2019s share of GDP from roughly 19% to 25% by 2030. \u201cTo reach the $ 36 billion target, comprising $ 28 billion from merchandise and over $ 8 billion from services, Sri Lanka must sustain annual export growth of 10-12% from 2026 onwards,\u201d he said. Wijesinghe accepted the challenge of moving beyond Sri Lanka\u2019s traditional sectors, stressing that product and value-chain diversification must be paired with market diversification and structural reform. He said the Government\u2019s strategy, embodied in a soon-to-be-published National Export Development Plan (NEDP) for 2026\u20132030, aims for total export receipts of about $ 36 billion by the end of the four years, driven by faster growth in both merchandise and services exports. \u201cThe finalised NEDP will be presented in January 2026 and will provide the roadmap for translating targets into investment, skills development, and new-market penetration. If implemented, the combination of tariff reform, digital trade facilitation, renewed trade diplomacy, and focused sector development could substantially de-risk the economy and put exports on a higher-growth trajectory,\u201d he explained. According to him, the plan, which the EDB has prepared in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and after months of stakeholder consultations, rests on three pillars; boosting trade competitiveness, expanding regional and global market linkages, and promoting sustainable, trade-led growth. To change the composition of the export basket, he said the EDB has identified priority sectors beyond apparel, coconut, rubber, and tea, which together still comprise an estimated 60% of current export value. He identified several \u201ctier one\u201d sectors earmarked for rapid expansion, including ICT/BPM, which is expected to surpass $ 1.7 billion this year and grow to over $ 5 billion by 2030, as well as logistics, electronics and electrical manufacturing, food and beverages, spices, and gems and jewellery. \u201cLogistics alone, currently generating around $ 1.7 billion, is projected to grow by 15-20% annually given Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic geographic position. In addition, we have identified mineral-based exports as a high-potential tier-two sector that remains significantly underutilised,\u201d he added. He said market diversification will also be key to the strategy. \u201cThe US still remains the single largest market, accounting for nearly 25% of Sri Lanka\u2019s export earnings, and Europe contributes about 22%. The EDB is pushing for deeper penetration into African, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets. Exports to these regions have grown by over 25% during the January-October period, underscoring their potential,\u201d he pointed out. The EDB Chief also noted that economic diplomacy has been strengthened, with foreign missions now assigned export performance targets. \u201cTo capitalise on this momentum, the EDB plans to strengthen economic diplomacy and has set performance targets for Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign missions. We are also pushing a formal review of existing free trade agreements (FTAs) and preferential trade arrangements (PTAs) and are proposing negotiations on new FTAs and PTAs to support the $ 36 billion objective,\u201d he said. He noted that a Ministerial Committee, chaired by Trade, Commerce and Food Security Ministry Secretary K.A. Vimalenthirarajah, has been constituted to evaluate current agreements and will report early next year. Wijesinghe highlighted significant policy reforms included in the 2026 Budget, particularly efforts to modernise the country\u2019s outdated tariff structure to create a transparent and investor-friendly environment. \u201cThe long-discussed National Single Window has finally secured Rs. 2.5 billion in funding to move forward, enabling full online integration of key agencies including the Board of Investment (BOI), EDB, Customs, and the Land Ministry to streamline trade processes and shift to e-invoicing,\u201d he said. The EDB Chief also stated the reactivation of the Export Development Council of Ministers (EDCM), chaired by the President and revived after nearly 20 years, as a significant governance step. \u201cThe EDCM will play a key role in policy coordination, especially in light of the reconstruction needs following recent disasters. The Council, exporter forums, and sectoral task forces will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NEDP and ensuring that reforms remain aligned with national priorities,\u201d he added. He said the new strategy reflects a decisive shift in Sri Lanka\u2019s export ambitions, balancing diversification, market expansion, and policy modernisation to reduce economic risk and accelerate growth. \u201cThe goal is not only to boost revenue, but to transform the export sector into a more resilient and technologically advanced engine of the economy,\u201d Wijesinghe pointed out.

He said the greatest challenge is breaking the cycle in which progress is followed by repeated setbacks. \u201cOur biggest challenge is achieving sustainable and equitable development while dealing with overlapping crises. We just completed historic debt restructuring and then Cyclone Ditwah struck. Although we managed to recover from the economic crisis, our economy is still fragile and now over a million people have been affected by disaster. We have to move beyond the cycle where every achievement is temporary. We must prove that Sri Lanka remains resilient and viable,\u201d President Dissanayake told Newsweek which described the interview as candid. On geopolitical ties, Dissanayake said Sri Lanka retains the autonomy to work with major partners but does not frame those relationships as a balancing act. He said the country\u2019s ties with India are deep and historic, China remains a strategic economic partner, and the United States is Sri Lanka\u2019s largest export market. \u201cIndia is our closest neighbour and first responder. China is a strong economic and political partner. The United States and Sri Lanka also have deep ties and shared democratic values. We don\u2019t look at our relations with these important countries as balancing. Each of our relationships is important to us.\u201d On relations with Washington, he said Sri Lanka wants market access, climate finance and technology partnerships. \u201cWe need climate finance. We just lost several billions of dollars due to Cyclone Ditwah. We need grants for early warning systems, resilient infrastructure and coastal protection. We want US companies to invest in digital infrastructure, manufacturing and renewable energy. What we offer is a strategically placed, stable, democratic partner in the Indo Pacific.\u201d On debt sustainability, Dissanayake said the post-default recovery is now intersecting with climate impacts and that international frameworks must evolve. \u201cWe will have to service debt while simultaneously rebuilding from climate disasters. This is why debt sustainability frameworks for climate-vulnerable countries must change. We are increasing Government revenue, broadening our tax base through digitalisation and protecting social spending. We cannot impose austerity on people who have lost everything.\u201d He outlined the domestic relief agenda shaped by Cyclone Ditwah, including rebuilding homes, restoring agriculture and maintaining targeted subsidies. He said the Government expects these measures to provide visible relief while remaining within IMF parameters. On investment, Dissanayake said Sri Lanka is putting in place predictable rules and institutions to meet long-standing investor concerns. \u201cWe are establishing transparent, rules-based evaluation with clear criteria. Foreign investors want clarity, consistency and confidence. We have introduced a single-window approval system. We are drafting a new Investment Protection Act. There will be no special treatment for insiders. Approvals will be made on merit and national benefit.\u201d On long-running Chinese infrastructure projects, including Hambantota and Port City, he said these are commercial realities that must be managed to protect economic value and national sovereignty. \u201cThe Hambantota Port operates transparently. Our Navy and customs are in control. The lease is commercial, not military. Port City is a commercial development. We have to monitor operations, ensure compliance with Sri Lankan law and maintain sovereignty. These projects are realities that we must manage with a clear-eyed assessment of our interests.\u201d On disaster response and future preparedness, he said the Government will overhaul systems exposed by Cyclone Ditwah. \u201cCyclone Ditwah was catastrophic. Response was rapid but longstanding weaknesses were visible. We have launched a comprehensive review of disaster management systems. We will improve forecasting, pre-position equipment, and map high-risk areas. With climate change, destruction of this scale should have been expected. At least now we will put effective and accountable systems in place.\u201d He said Sri Lanka risks being trapped in a cycle of climate shocks unless investment and global support shift to resilience. \u201cWe will be trapped if we don\u2019t act now. Help us build climate-resilient infrastructure. Help us diversify our economy towards climate-resilient industries. Share technology so communities have time to evacuate. Help us build natural mitigation systems. We must break this cycle.\u201d Throughout the interview, Dissanayake used the platform to signal that recovery, geopolitical steadiness and climate adaptation form the core of his Government\u2019s economic strategy as it attempts to draw investment and rebuild confidence after successive crises.

In a 5 December dated statement Moody\u2019s said: \u201cSince mid-November, countries in South and Southeast Asia have been pummelled by several tropical cyclones which, combined with unusually heavy monsoon rains, have caused severe flooding and landslides, and the tragic loss of hundreds of lives.\u201d The agency added: \u201cThe economic, fiscal and credit impact of the disaster is likely to be most material for Sri Lanka (Caa1 stable).\u201d Moody\u2019s places Sri Lanka in a group of highly exposed countries, noting that Sri Lanka, as well as Indonesia (Baa2 stable), the Philippines (Baa2 stable) and Vietnam (Ba2 stable) all have high credit exposure to physical climate risks. \u201cSri Lanka has much weaker fiscal capacity to increase its resilience than its neighbours.\u201d These conditions, Moody\u2019s says, heighten the consequences of the current disaster for a sovereign still navigating post-default stabilisation. The agency also connects climate risk outcomes to institutional capacity. \u201cEffective governance is also key in mitigating such risks and often correlates with lower physical climate risk vulnerability in regions of high exposure. While recent reforms have led to some improvement, both Sri Lanka and Vietnam have governance issuer profile scores of 4, indicating high credit exposure to governance risks.\u201d In its wider regional view, Moody\u2019s says credit implications for other affected Governments will be more limited. Although Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam share similar climate-risk exposure, their stronger fiscal positions give them more room to respond. However, Moody\u2019s warns of broader structural vulnerabilities across the region, saying that the severity of the flooding highlights broader credit vulnerabilities to physical climate risks over the longer term, especially given limited natural catastrophe insurance coverage in the region. Last October, Moody\u2019s said Sri Lanka\u2019s macroeconomic recovery remained broadly on track. It has had expected the current account to stay in surplus in 2025, supported by tourism and remittances despite a rise in vehicle imports. But it cautioned that Sri Lanka\u2019s narrow revenue base and dependence on external financing remain key vulnerabilities if the global environment shifts. It said Sri Lanka\u2019s fiscal strength remained constrained by a high debt burden and very low debt affordability, even as reforms with development-partner support were beginning to show results. The stable outlook reflected balanced risks: further reforms could lift the rating, while weaker policy momentum or a deterioration in external buffers would put pressure on it. The agency said sustained reform momentum under the IMF program could strengthen the credit profile, while any weakening of external buffers or reversal of reforms would raise downside risks. In the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, Sri Lanka was compelled to request the IMF for additional relief. The IMF is reviewing a request for about $ 200 million Rapid Financing Instrument which is expected this year. The Fifth Review under the Extended Fund Facility was to be finalised on 15 December resulting in the release of a $ 347 million tranche provided the 2026 Budget resonated with the program parameters. However, the Government and the IMF have agreed to push the review to early 2026 on account of the emerging fiscal conditions post-Ditwah.

Delivering the keynote at the \u2018Investment Point of View\u2019 session of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, he said the country\u2019s hard-won stability now provides a crucial opening to lift public investment, strengthen competitiveness, and scale islands of excellence in high-value sectors. \u201cFiscal consolidation must not be seen as an end in itself, but as the foundation for long-term development, serving to unlock infrastructure expansion, exports, and productivity-driven growth,\u201d he stressed. He noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery from the crisis is built on measurable gains, including a current account surplus, exceeding International Monetary Fund (IMF) targets for the primary surplus, and a projected decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio to below 95%, ahead of the IMF\u2019s 2032 timeline. However, he cautioned that maintaining this trajectory is essential for foreign and domestic investor confidence, particularly as the State cannot finance the country\u2019s development priorities alone. \u201cProgress achieved so far must now be followed by deeper reforms to improve the overall business environment,\u201d he added. He pointed to the power sector as a critical example, where unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) under the broader State-owned enterprise (SOE) restructuring agenda signals improved governance and the potential to attract investment into renewable energy. He opined that Sri Lanka will require close to $ 11 billion by 2030 to meet its climate and net-zero commitments, and that predictable power purchase agreements, transparent pricing, and adherence to global environmental and governance standards are essential to draw long-term institutional capital. He added that the World Bank Group, including the IFC, is supporting these efforts through guarantees, risk-sharing tools, and instruments designed to de-risk both equity and debt investments in the real economy. Fakhoury underscored the need to level the playing field for both domestic and foreign investors, particularly in areas such as land access and sectoral ownership restrictions. He called for stronger Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) financing, highlighting a gap equivalent to 20% of GDP, and urged swift operationalisation of the new Secured Transactions Act to unlock credit for small businesses, including women-led enterprises. Additional reforms in competition policy, labour laws, trade facilitation, and public sector governance, he said, are necessary to drive investment, enhance transparency, and reduce the costs of doing business. Fakhoury said the direction outlined in the 2026 Budget, placing private sector-led growth at the centre, reflects an essential shift. But he noted that consistent policy, minimal reversals, and rapid implementation of the Economic Transformation Act\u2019s key elements, including the public-private partnership (PPP), insolvency and investment protection laws, will determine whether Sri Lanka can scale investment and achieve durable growth. He identified renewable energy, logistics, export-oriented industries, digital services, specialised manufacturing, agribusiness, and high-value tourism as the sectors with the strongest potential to propel Sri Lanka towards its ambition of 7% annual GDP expansion. He noted that the Colombo Port\u2019s role as a critical transshipment hub can be further strengthened by focusing on efficient port operations, expanding logistics and supply chain services, and maximising port capacity to attract global investment. \u201cSri Lanka must shift decisively from an inward-focused model to an export-driven strategy through new free trade agreements (FTAs), modernised tariff policies, and smoother trade facilitation,\u201d he stressed. Highlighting that the country already hosts high-performing \u201cislands of excellence\u201d in specialised manufacturing, digital services, and niche agribusinesses, he said these should be scaled through expanded Board of Investment (BOI) and sector-specific zones, improved digital infrastructure, better STEM skills, and strong branding for premium agro-products. Fakhoury said Sri Lanka possesses all attributes needed to become one of Asia\u2019s premier destinations. To reach the goal of $ 8 billion in annual earnings and 4 million visitors, he called for a destination management framework that elevates high-value segments such as wellness, Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE), surfing, and nature-based tourism, while improving connectivity and development in the island\u2019s east and north. \u201cThe partnerships and consensus emerging from the two-day summit reflect a shared recognition that Sri Lanka\u2019s future should not be defined merely by resilience, but by competitive excellence,\u201d he said. He reiterated that the World Bank Group and IFC stand ready to support the private and public sectors as the country seeks to consolidate its recovery, accelerate investment, and position itself as a gateway to regional opportunity. \u201cSri Lanka can achieve much more than stabilisation. It can transform,\u201d he said, urging State institutions and businesses to work \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d to turn renewed confidence into sustained, job-creating growth.

The performance also pushes year-to-date (YTD) arrivals to over 2.14 million, marking a 16.3% growth compared with the same period last year. India continued its lead as Sri Lanka\u2019s largest tourist source market during the first week of December, contributing 8,890 arrivals, or 21% of the total. It was followed by Russia with 4,735 travellers, Germany with 4,399 visitors, the UK with 3,053, and China with 2,571 tourists. Other notable contributors included travellers from Australia, Poland, France, the US, and Spain. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has projected 344,309 arrivals for December. Based on current trends and the daily average of 6,190 visitors registered in the first week, it appears that the country is well-placed to meet this forecast. Cumulatively, India has driven the strongest inflows YTD with 483,785 visitors, followed by the UK with 194,795, Russia with 163,328, Germany with 135,658, and China with 124,242. The strength of India and the European markets has been instrumental in sustaining double-digit growth throughout the year. If the country achieves the expected December total, annual arrivals for 2025 will likely close at around 2.44-2.45 million. This outcome fits neatly within the SLTDA\u2019s \u2018Lower Scenario\u2019 of 2.415 million and aligns closely with external projections such as CT Smith Securities\u2019 estimate of 2.4 million arrivals for the year. Sri Lanka originally targeted 3 million arrivals and $ 5 billion in tourism earnings for 2025. The SLTDA later revised expectations into three forecast paths: a \u2018Lower Scenario\u2019 of 2.415 million arrivals, a \u2018Conservative Scenario\u2019 of 2.676 million, and an \u2018Optimistic Scenario\u2019 of 3 million. Assessing the current performance, it places the country firmly within the lower range and possibly edging towards the \u2018Conservative Scenario\u2019 depending on December\u2019s final numbers. However, the optimistic target of 3 million remains out of reach. A recent sector analysis by CT Smith Securities reinforces this view, projecting 2.4 million arrivals and $ 3.4 billion in earnings for 2025. The report noted that while the industry has made one of its strongest recoveries since the disruptions of 2019 to 2022, the time needed for long-haul source markets to fully scale up and capacity limitations across the sector mean that exponential year-end growth is unlikely. It added that the outlook for 2026 is more upbeat, with visitor numbers expected to reach 3 million and tourism revenue projected at $ 4.3 billion. The strong first-week performance provides further momentum, suggesting that December\u2019s full-month arrival requirement is well within reach. This was further cemented by leading industry associations\u2014The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) and Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO)\u2014reassuring that the outlook for the season remains strong, supported by coordinated industry action, strong diplomatic engagement, and reaffirmed confidence from global travel partners. Even with the unlikelihood of reaching the ambitious original target, the industry experts noted that Sri Lanka is poised to close 2025 with its highest post-crisis performance. \u201cThe resilience shown during the first week of December, in spite of weather-related disruptions, underscores renewed confidence in the destination and strengthens the foundation for tourism growth heading into 2026,\u201d they added.

The Colombo Stock Exchange has approved the listing of 50 million debentures, each with a face value of Rs. 100 each and a tenor of five years. The issue has received a preliminary \u2018A\u2019 rating with a Positive Outlook from Lanka Rating Agency, highlighting Assetline Finance\u2019s creditworthiness, robust capital position, prudent risk management, and ability to navigate evolving market conditions.

The Stage 3 Impairment Coverage Ratio increased to 55%, up from 37.2% in the previous year\u2019s corresponding period, reflecting stronger provisioning discipline.

The relief scheme adds fiscal pressure at a time when the Treasury is attempting to consolidate public finances under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. But the Government has signalled that immediate stabilisation of disaster-affected areas takes precedence, with financing routed mainly through the Defence Ministry and implemented via Divisional Secretariats nationwide. Although the Circular does not indicate the total fiscal outlay, the scale of payments suggests a significant expenditure at a time when the Government is attempting to rebuild confidence following 2022\u2019s external debt standstill. On Friday, President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake addressing Parliament said the Government would submit a Rs. 50 billion supplementary estimate for immediate relief spending for 2025 and a separate Rs. 500 billion for 2026. He said that a request has been made to the IMF to allow the country to access $ 200 million from special drawing rights. The IMF was also requested that the next $ 347 million tranche under the External Fund Facility (EFF) due later this month to be increased. The recent measures, set out in the Finance Ministry Budget Circular No. 08/2025 of 5 December, outline direct cash transfers, housing reconstruction grants, and sector-specific compensation for farmers, small enterprises, and fishing communities. According to the Circular, households will receive a one-time payment of Rs. 25,000 to clean and safely re-enter homes affected by flooding and landslides. Families whose kitchens or essential living spaces have been rendered unusable will be granted Rs. 50,000. Additional resettlement allowances are available for families requiring temporary shelter, including up to Rs. 25,000 per month for those whose homes were fully destroyed. The largest fiscal commitments relate to housing reconstruction, payments of up to Rs. 5 million, will be provided to families whose houses were completely damaged, either for rebuilding on existing land or purchasing a new plot where State land cannot be allocated. Partially damaged homes may qualify for up to Rs. 250,000, subject to on-site assessment by officials. Agriculture, one of the sectors most disrupted by the cyclone, will receive compensation for crop and livestock losses. Farmers may claim Rs. 150,000 per hectare for paddy, grains, and field crops, and Rs. 200,000 per hectare for vegetable cultivation. Registered livestock farmers will be paid Rs. 20,000 per animal lost. Small industries and micro-enterprises may receive Rs. 200,000 per unit to restore machinery and resume operations, while fishers may receive up to Rs. 400,000 for damaged vessels. The Government also announced payments of Rs. 15,000 to support schoolchildren affected by the disaster, along with Rs. 1 million to families of those who died or were rendered permanently disabled. The Finance Ministry said that the scheme must be administered with strict verification processes, referencing earlier disaster-relief circulars that govern damage assessment. The guidelines stipulate that duplicate claims are prohibited and that certain categories of relief must be adjusted to account for earlier payments made under separate disaster-relief programs. The relief package applies only to areas formally designated as disaster zones following Cyclone Ditwah, but may be used in addition to other Government assistance schemes now underway. Officials have been instructed to implement the measures immediately, with payments channelled through local administrations under Treasury oversight.

Nandalal Weerasinghe \u2013 Pic by Ruwan Walpola Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe has warned that Sri Lanka cannot afford to forget the reform agenda that underpins the country\u2019s stabilisation, even as post-Ditwah reconstruction demands immediate Government attention. Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, he said the country\u2019s foundation for growth remains fragile and depends on discipline in macroeconomic management and the timely implementation of structural reforms. \u201cThe stability that we have basically achieved is a foundation for growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen going forward, we need to ensure we maintain monetary stability, fiscal stability, and also external stability. That is important, and also financial stability. So, when going forward, for us to move into a higher growth path, we should not weaken the foundation for stability.\u201d He warned that the reform trajectory must not be derailed by the disaster response. \u201cWe should not forget that we need to focus on this area,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these short-term shocks we can absorb. I am sure the fiscal space is there. We can manage that. I am not too concerned about that.\u201d Dr. Weerasinghe said the Central Bank expects supply chain disruptions from the cyclone to cause only a brief increase in inflation. \u201cWe might see a small uptick in inflation as a result of these supply chain disruptions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is something we do not have to worry about. But that could reflect, given the real inflation environment. This 2 percent inflation going up to 3 percent will not be a surprise, given the short-term impact.\u201d He said inflation should revert once bottlenecks clear. \u201cOver a period of time, once supply chain issues are addressed, I would say we will come back to the normal inflation trajectory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will maintain stability going forward, as we have been doing so far under the framework.\u201d He also said the cyclone will not produce a major balance of payments shock. \u201cExternal impact, I do not see as a significant impact from this event,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we see is an immediate impact that will be more cyclical.\u201d Reviewing global risks, he said earlier concerns over US tariff policy had eased. \u201cWe had a lot of concerns at that point. Now we can see that it has been softening in terms of its impact on Sri Lanka as well as other markets,\u201d he said. \u201cCompared to where we were, that issue, I think, to a certain extent is again stabilising in my view.\u201d He noted that political developments and energy prices remain uncertainties, though Sri Lanka\u2019s rising reliance on renewable energy mitigates exposure to global price swings. Domestically, he said pent-up demand for agricultural imports had temporarily pushed the current account into a small deficit, but this was normalising. \u201cNow we can see that this is also settling down,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, we saw some pressure on the external side last month. Now it is gradually settling down.\u201d The CBSL Governor downplayed the impact of global interest rate changes. \u201cI do not see that as a significant impact on our balance of payments side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have much exposure to these kinds of global interest rates.\u201d However, he cautioned that disruptions in supply chains could present modest challenges for exporters. \u201cThis impact could be a small shock in terms of supply chain disruption, especially for our suppliers here,\u201d Dr. Weerasinghe said. \u201cThat we will have to manage.\u201d On medium-term growth, Dr. Weerasinghe said Sri Lanka must convert consumption-led demand into investment. Sovereign rating improvements, trade reforms and productivity gains are essential conditions, he said. \u201cI think we are hoping that there will be an improvement in this rating,\u201d he said. \u201cFacilitation through reforms, making the business environment easier through some of the reforms already included in the World Bank budget support programme, those are very important reforms.\u201d He highlighted reducing non-tariff barriers, labour productivity reforms and stronger regional integration as priorities. \u201cWe need to have important reforms implemented to improve the productivity of labour and also reduce the barriers to trade and have access to regional markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Government has made a decision to link up with RCEP. This is a very important link-up for supply chains in the region for us to have much more open trade.\u201d He closed by reiterating that stability must be actively maintained. \u201cWe will maintain stability going forward, as we have been doing so far under the framework,\u201d he said.

This financing builds on earlier initiatives to establish a more stable and financially sustainable power sector. This second subprogram of ADB\u2019s Power Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program will accelerate the unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) into independent successor companies for generation, transmission, system operation, and distribution, as mandated by the Electricity Act of 2024 and its 2025 amendment. The phased approach ensures a structured transition, ensuring progress in reform actions and prioritising financial sustainability. ADB Sri Lanka Country Director Takafumi Kadono said: \u201cSri Lanka has made important progress in stabilising its economy and strengthening its fiscal position. A well-functioning power sector is vital for the country\u2019s continued recovery and sustainable growth. ADB is committed to supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s long-term development and advancing key reforms in the power sector. This initiative will enhance power sector governance, foster private sector participation, and accelerate renewable energy development to drive sustainable recovery, resilience, and inclusive growth.\u201d To improve financial sustainability, the program will help implement cost-reflective tariffs and a comprehensive debt restructuring plan for the CEB. It will support the new independent successor companies in transparent allocation of existing debts. This will continue to strengthen their financial viability, enhance creditworthiness, and enable these companies to operate on a more sustainable footing. The program also aims to strengthen renewable energy development and private sector participation by enhancing transparency and supporting power sector entities that are financially sustainable. It will enable competitive procurement for large-scale renewable energy projects and identified priority generation schemes, while upholding strong environmental standards. Promoting gender equality and social inclusion is integral to the program. Energy sector agencies have implemented annual women\u2019s leadership programs, adopted inclusive policies, and launched feedback mechanisms to ensure equitable participation of female consumers and entrepreneurs. The program includes targeted support for vulnerable groups, such as maintaining lifeline tariffs and implementing measures to soften the impact of tariff adjustments and sector reforms. ADB will provide an additional $ 2.5 million technical assistance grant from its Technical Assistance Special Fund to support program implementation, build the capacity of successor companies, and help develop their business plans and power system development plans. ADB is a leading multilateral development bank supporting inclusive, resilient, and sustainable growth across Asia and the Pacific.

A discussion meeting was held recently at the EDB premises, with the participation of Secretary to the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Tilaka Jayasundara, EDB Chairman and CEO Mangala Wijesinghe, Acting Director General Erandika Dissanayake, Acting Additional Director General Kumudinie Mudalige, Trade Facilitation and Trade Information Director Dr. Sanjeewa Rathnasekara along with senior officials and exporters. The EDB has already commenced comprehensive damage assessments of exporters most affected by the adverse weather conditions. These assessments will guide the targeted relief interventions required for the export sector. EDB Chairman emphasised that strategic interventions are actively underway to tackle immediate challenges facing the export sector. These measures focus on minimising disruptions to export operations to ensure a steady flow of goods and services to international markets. Additionally, efforts are being made to mitigate the adverse impact on production capacity, safeguarding the ability of exporters to maintain output levels. A key priority is also placed on reactivating disrupted supply chains, restoring the seamless connectivity essential for efficient production and export processes. Through these targeted actions, the EDB aims to sustain export growth and build resilience against short-term obstacles. The EDB is currently working closely with customs, port authorities, and logistics providers to manage infrastructure delays caused by adverse weather conditions and expedite export-related clearances. Special Government attention has now been focused on assisting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in particular to rapidly reactivate their operational capacity during this recovery process. The discussion highlighted the growing intensity and frequency of climate-related challenges in recent times, underscoring the urgent need for proactive and sustainable responses. It was emphasised that addressing these environmental issues is not only critical for mitigating risks but also essential for ensuring long-term economic resilience.

A discussion meeting was held recently at the EDB premises, with the participation of Secretary to the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Tilaka Jayasundara, EDB Chairman and CEO Mangala Wijesinghe, Acting Director General Erandika Dissanayake, Acting Additional Director General Kumudinie Mudalige, Trade Facilitation and Trade Information Director Dr. Sanjeewa Rathnasekara along with senior officials and exporters. The EDB has already commenced comprehensive damage assessments of exporters most affected by the adverse weather conditions. These assessments will guide the targeted relief interventions required for the export sector. EDB Chairman emphasised that strategic interventions are actively underway to tackle immediate challenges facing the export sector. These measures focus on minimising disruptions to export operations to ensure a steady flow of goods and services to international markets. Additionally, efforts are being made to mitigate the adverse impact on production capacity, safeguarding the ability of exporters to maintain output levels. A key priority is also placed on reactivating disrupted supply chains, restoring the seamless connectivity essential for efficient production and export processes. Through these targeted actions, the EDB aims to sustain export growth and build resilience against short-term obstacles. The EDB is currently working closely with customs, port authorities, and logistics providers to manage infrastructure delays caused by adverse weather conditions and expedite export-related clearances. Special Government attention has now been focused on assisting Small and Medium Enterprises SMEs in particular to rapidly reactivate their operational capacity during this recovery process. The discussion highlighted the growing intensity and frequency of climate-related challenges in recent times, underscoring the urgent need for proactive and sustainable responses. It was emphasised that addressing these environmental issues is not only critical for mitigating risks but also essential for ensuring long-term economic resilience. By integrating sustainability into export practices and promoting green technologies, the EDB aims to strengthen the export sectors competitiveness and sustainability. This approach seeks to support exporters in adapting to climate realities while fostering greener and more resilient trade pathways that align with global environmental goals.

Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit last week, Sood said Axiata\u2019s investment decisions are never driven solely by shareholder returns, but by a broader \u2018return to stakeholders\u2019, shaped by a country\u2019s vision, regulatory stability, market structure, macroeconomic signals and the strength of local talent. \u201cEvery business has to decide, where to put its capital.

We believe we can add value not just to the Government\u2019s vision, but to society in healthcare, financial services, education and more,\u201d Sood said. He also cited Sri Lanka\u2019s market scale and structure, the population\u2019s appetite for innovation, and what he described as a constructive regulatory culture. \u201cThere are challenges in every market,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut what we find attractive is the willingness to consult and have a dialogue. If you have that willingness to discuss and debate, you find solutions that are long-term and value-accretive.\u201d Axiata, which owns Dialog Axiata, has used Sri Lanka for decades as a test bed for new technologies, including early rollouts of 2G, 3G, 4G and now 5G trials.

Samaratunga and Pathfinder Foundation Distinguished Fellow Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy with participants focusing on theme, \u201cManaging Public Finance: The South Asian Experience\u201d  The Pathfinder Foundation conducted a high-level event, focusing on the theme \u201cManaging Public Finance: The South Asian Experience.\u201d The event, held in a hybrid format, brought together university scholars, representatives from leading think tanks, and experts in related fields. Pathfinder Foundation Chairman Bernard Goonetilleke, in his opening remarks stressed the importance of sound fiscal governance in the wake of the socio-political crises experienced in Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh in recent years\u2014which indicate that South Asia can no longer treat fiscal policy as secondary or routine. His remarks concluded on the note that the discussion was of vital importance in the wake of the catastrophic cyclone that ravaged Sri Lanka the previous week. Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) Asia and Pacific Department Director Anoop Singh, delivered the keynote address, emphasising that the global economy is heading into a new era characterised by significant changes in the international trading environment, where the role of public finance and its management as catalysts for economic growth has been highlighted. This shift, however, could not be timelier, given the historic highs global debt has reached. \u201cWhat you cannot see, you cannot manage,\u201d Singh said that one of the main drivers of increasing global debt is \u201cdata gaps\u201d caused by inconsistently defined, misclassified, and unreported debt and expenditure, among other issues. Additionally, Singh asserted that these data gaps are deliberate and that a framework for global financial reporting of this calibre must be established by developing systems that monitor and audit, supported by institutions that uphold these systems. Pathfinder Foundation Distinguished Fellow and Former Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga and Pathfinder Foundation Distinguished Fellow Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy also share their insights. The concluding remarks were given by Pathfinder Foundation Executive Director Dr. Dayaratna Silva who expressed his sincere gratitude to Anoop Sing for his excellent presentation. He also mentioned the support that Singh has consistently provided to Sri Lanka when landmark economic reforms were carried out in 1977. He appreciated the contributions of key resource persons, who clarified complex issues in public finance with remarkable clarity and insight. The Pathfinder Foundation continues to facilitate dialogue between related field experts, aiming to direct Sri Lanka towards a sustainable and prosperous future.

However, it is by no means insurmountable. The well-established and highly coordinated industry network is fully geared to confront these issues head-on. While some tea-growing areas in the Uva and the Central Province experienced some impact, there has been no loss of manufacturing capacity,\u201d the Association noted in a statement yesterday. It added that the damage was largely confined to specific roads, resulting in temporary disruptions to transportation. Some of the key routes connecting plantations to the city have now been reopened, and transport services are resuming normal operations. \u201cThe harvesting operations are gradually returning to normal, with access roads been reopened and temporary access roads been constructed to facilitate transport of green leaf and produce. The majority of plantations and smallholder lands in the South of the Island along with the main road network have been spared from cyclone damage. As a result, harvesting, manufacturing and transportation activities are continuing as usual,\u201d it noted. CTTA stated that the trading activities at the Colombo Tea Auctions continue to be held albeit with a revised calendar. The Tea Auction previously set for the first week of December has been rescheduled to the last week of December. This adjustment ensures uninterrupted financial flows to the Producers, including Smallholders, maintaining the momentum of the industry. \u201cThe rise of the Kelani River and the resulting floods affected a limited number of exporters\u2019 offices and warehouses. The floods have now receded and on an initial assessment it has been observed that some of the machinery such as tea bagging machines are damaged. The industry is working tirelessly to restore the damaged machinery and are fully equipped to serve the overseas clients without interruptions and assure timely delivery as usual,\u201d it added. Sri Lanka tea production from January to October is over 220.9 million kilograms (220,972,295 kilos) recording an increase of 3,318,755 kilos compared to same period of last year. The production in 2025 also surpasses the production of 2023 in a similar period. \u201cSri Lankan tea industry has consistently demonstrated its resilience in the face of adversities and are confident that with the collective efforts of all in the value chain, shall navigate these challenging times. The Colombo Tea Traders\u2019 Association shall continue to work with the officials of the Government to speedily resolve any issues in a collaborative approach. Together we are all united in our commitment to supply \u2018Ceylon Tea\u2019 globally and remain optimistic about the future,\u201d the statement added. CTTA is the private sector apex body of the tea industry. The Committee of the association encompasses a broad spectrum of industry stakeholders that includes representatives from The Planters\u2019 Association of Ceylon, Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners\u2019 Association, Colombo Brokers Association, Tea Exporters\u2019 Association, Sri Lanka Federation of Tea Smallholdings Development Societies and Tea Small Holding Development Authority. The tea industry has, time and again, demonstrated its remarkable capacity to overcome adversity, with all stakeholders uniting collectively to address and resolve challenges. In the recent past, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry ensured continuity by successfully digitalising the tea auction process, transitioning from the traditional outcry system to a fully virtual platform, thereby maintaining uninterrupted weekly auctions. Similarly, during the period of severe economic crisis, despite numerous constraints, production, sales, and exports continued without disturbance.

Speaking during a panel discussion last week at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Herath clarified that the project stems from a tender initiated several years ago, prior to the current administration. He said since assuming office, the Government has engaged in multiple negotiation rounds to align Sinopec\u2019s proposal with the original tender conditions. In January 2025, Chinese State-owned oil and gas giant China Petrochemical Corporation, commonly known as Sinopec, entered into an agreement with the Sri Lankan Government to expedite the construction of a state-of-the-art $ 3.7 billion oil refinery in the investment zone near Hambantota International Port (HIP). The agreement includes provisions to fast-track unresolved issues related to water access, land allocation, and taxes, marking the largest single foreign direct investment (FDI) in Sri Lanka\u2019s history. Herath noted that while Sinopec had sought greater access to the domestic market citing shifts in global market dynamics since the original bid was submitted, the Government has maintained a firm position that it cannot deviate from the terms of the tender, which was strictly for an export-oriented facility. \u201cNegotiations have been completed. The final offer has gone to Sinopec. We believe we will have feedback and hopefully a confirmation within a matter of days,\u201d he said. Once Sinopec conveys its official position, the agreement will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval. Herath underscored that both the Government and Sinopec remain committed to finalising the deal. Calling it a \u201csignificant investment for the country,\u201d he said the project has the potential to be one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest export-oriented ventures and stressed that its successful conclusion would mark a major milestone for the new administration\u2019s investment push. \u201cWe expect this to happen before the end of the year,\u201d Herath added, reaffirming confidence that the long-delayed project is now nearing closure.

In steering a bold new course for leadership, one prioritising psychological strength, authentic purpose, and human connection as the foundation for enduring success, JXG pioneered a proactive blueprint for corporate stability. The JXG Holistic Leadership Summit 2025 which unfolded recently was designed to future-proof the business, creating a replicable model for how companies can retain top talent and drive sustainable growth in uncertain times. The unconventional leadership event was a curated journey of introspection, dialogue, and renewal, helping leaders align personal well-being with professional impact. The inspiring convergence united senior leaders from the Group with two internationally acclaimed facilitators; Nick Jonsson, a renowned speaker and author, widely recognised for his advocacy of mental health in executive leadership, and complementing his insights was Dona Amelia, a Southeast Asian entrepreneur and empowerment coach celebrated for her transformative journey and leadership impact. In the summit, participants explored five core dimensions of holistic leadership: surrender, purpose, connection, goals, and discipline. These themes encouraged leaders to reflect deeply on what it means to lead with intention, empathy, and steadiness in today\u2019s complex business environment. JXG Group Chief Human Resources Officer Wasanthi Stephen said, \u201cAt JXG, we aim to nurture leaders who uplift, empower and evolve together.

Through this pioneering initiative, we are building leaders and a future-ready organisation rooted in human values and enduring capacity.\u201d Under the guidance of Nick and Dona, participants engaged in immersive sessions challenging traditional leadership paradigms and encouraged vulnerability, openness, and self-awareness. Through reflective exercises, storytelling, and peer dialogue, leaders were invited to explore how their personal values and emotional well-being shape their professional influence. A highlight of the summit was the inspiring panel discussion titled \u2018The Future of Leadership is Holistic \u2013 Are We Ready?\u2019 featuring JXG\u2019s own senior leaders. Their candid insights offered a window into how holistic practices are being integrated throughout the Group, from talent development and performance management to culture-building and strategic decision-making. The conversation strengthened JXG\u2019s vision of leadership being a shared culture of trust, growth, and collective energy. Throughout the summit, one message resonated clearly: when leaders nurture their emotional, mental, physical, social, and psychological well-being, they create ripple effects which can strengthen teams, build innovation, and drive long-term organisational success. Leadership then becomes more than achieving results, but about building healthier, more connected, and future-ready organisations.

Q: How would you characterise JKH\u2019s Q2 performance against the broader economic backdrop? Niroshan: The macro environment has clearly stabilised, with inflation around 5%, a steadier currency and interest rates in the high single digits. Tourism has exceeded 1.97 million arrivals, growing double digits, and remittances remain strong. This has supported consumption, with Supermarkets and Consumer Foods seeing low to mid-teens growth in volumes and same store sales. In this environment, JKH reported an 88% rise in revenue to Rs. 144.8 billion in Q2. The New Energy Vehicle business (JKCG/BYD) handed over about 3,700 units and has more than 3,800 orders in the pipeline. EBITDA more than doubled to Rs. 18.4 billion, with PBT up 243% and PAT up 176%. Leisure moved from a loss to an EBITDA profit, and City of Dreams Sri Lanka, though still in its launch phase, was already close to EBITDA breakeven. The Group\u2019s broader confidence in its strategy and cash generation ability was also reflected in the doubling of its first interim dividend to Rs. 0.10 per share; a Rs. 1.8-billion payout. Sachintha: Performance was broadly in line with expectations, but particularly strong where structural tailwinds exist. Retail remained a standout, led by BYD, though the customs dispute and broader policy headwinds around EV imports remain near term challenges. Nations Trust Bank delivered another strong quarter as well, supporting Financial Services. Transportation posted solid volume growth but margins were affected by an unfavourable cargo mix, even as CWIT scaled faster than expected and SAGT benefitted from higher throughput at the Port of Colombo. City of Dreams Sri Lanka was almost at EBITDA breakeven. Despite finance costs from newly operational components, gearing remains comfortable and the core businesses continue to generate strong cash flows. Q: What are the key indicators that demonstrate the Group\u2019s underlying resilience? Niroshan: The clearest indicator is the step up in earnings. First half EBITDA reached Rs. 31.3 billion, up 98%, and the Group is on track to exceed last year\u2019s Rs. 45.7 billion. Even excluding CODSL and JKCG, Q2 PBT rose to about Rs. 4.3 billion from Rs. 1.6 billion, showing how broad based the improvement is. Operating cash flow over the last twelve months is around Rs. 41.3 billion, with Rs. 2.9 billion generated this quarter alone, supporting commitments as the Group moves from investment to harvest mode. ROCE has improved to roughly 3.5% on a last 12 months basis; still below pre crisis levels but clearly trending up. Sachintha: A major factor is that JKH has now completed its heavy capex cycle and moved into a phase focused on generating returns. Recurring EBITDA has strengthened, making cash flows more predictable. With rising earnings, improving cash generation and a stable near term capex outlook, the Group is well placed to meet upcoming obligations comfortably. Q: How comfortable are you with JKH\u2019s balance sheet, gearing and management of financial risk? Sachintha: As at 30 September 2025, gearing was around 32%, or closer to 30% excluding JKCG\u2019s trade facilities, which is very manageable for a conglomerate of this scale. The debt maturity profile is weighted toward FY26 and FY27, but the Group has ample refinancing flexibility. Currency and interest rate exposure are managed through a mix of Rupee and US dollar balances and by aligning borrowings with the broader debt profile. Strong foreign currency contributions from Leisure and Transportation add liquidity and help absorb movements in both the Rupee and global interest rates. Meanwhile, the borrowing book is actively balanced across fixed, variable and hedged positions. Niroshan: Net debt to EBITDA is about 3.5 times, a marked improvement from 8.4 times in FY2020/21. The Group\u2019s liquidity is solid, supported by operating cash flows, and it has moved beyond the capital-intensive phase of projects like CODSL. Furthermore, noncurrent borrowings exceed current obligations, reducing near term refinancing risk, and a refinancing planned for next year should extend maturities and improve the overall cost of debt. Thus, for a diversified group of its size, the financial positioning is healthy and manageable. Q: JKH has gone through a heavy capex phase. How do you view the investment strategy and return profile of assets like City of Dreams and West Container Terminal? Niroshan: City of Dreams Sri Lanka is a landmark $ 1.2 billion investment. The Nuwa Sri Lanka hotel, the first phase of The Shoppes mall and the luxury casino all opened in August 2025, and the project is now fully operational with no further outflows. The resort\u2019s EBITDA loss narrowed to Rs. 64 million in Q2, versus about Rs. 1.2 billion a year earlier, supported by rising occupancies, casino footfall and MICE bookings. The West Container Terminal is also progressing well; Phase 2 is underway and full completion is targeted for end 2026. WCT 1 is expected to be close to PAT breakeven this financial year, ahead of the typical first full year trajectory for a project of this scale. Sachintha: JKH is now moving past its most capex-intensive phase, with major projects like City of Dreams Sri Lanka and the West Container Terminal entering their operational ramps. COD is still early in its lifecycle, but the initial traction shows that the asset has the potential to scale meaningfully as tourism and MICE-related activity improve.

Additionally, CH17 has developed a program that could assist agencies who are in control over any type of aid relief work, to monitor on real time basis, the process and to take immediate action should there be shortcomings. CH17 has launched a special nationwide initiative to honour and support everyone working tirelessly on disaster relief efforts. The program will recognise first responders, donors, volunteers, welfare teams and media personnel who have stepped forward selflessly to help rebuild the country after the cyclone devastation. CH17 CEO Jumar Preena said, \u201cWe believe our country will rise again, but only if we take the time to recognise those who served first and served hardest. We will open this Privilege Program to all those risking their safety, time, and comfort to support the destitute. Their service is the foundation on which Sri Lanka will rebuild.\u201d As part of this initiative, CH17 will issue a simple digital privilege card to registered responders. This electronic card will carry the volunteer\u2019s name and a unique registration number. It will also include a scannable QR code and a 16-digit card number \u2014 just like a payment card number but used only for identity and fairness. When shown at participating stores, it will unlock special discounts funded entirely by merchants who wish to support caregivers. CH17 partner retailers from closed-group Privilege Networks, have been requested to accept the digital card and extend special discounts to responders during purchases. CH17 will also invite thousands more private merchants, shops and service providers to join this goodwill effort, so more volunteers can be supported in more places across the island. The entire initiative will be offered as CH17\u2019s contribution toward the national rebuilding mission led by the Rebuilding Sri Lanka Task Force. CH17 is prepared to launch the program immediately and begin issuing the first 10,000 cards under the theme Rebuild Sri Lanka. This is the first large-scale volunteer recognition and privilege support card introduced by an independent Sri Lankan organisation for disaster recovery efforts.

Additionally, CH17 has developed a program that could assist agencies who are in control over any type of aid relief work, to monitor on real time basis, the process and to take immediate action should there be shortcomings. CH17 has launched a special nationwide initiative to honour and support everyone working tirelessly on disaster relief efforts. The program will recognise first responders, donors, volunteers, welfare teams and media personnel who have stepped forward selflessly to help rebuild the country after the cyclone devastation. CH17 CEO Jumar Preena said, We believe our country will rise again, but only if we take the time to recognise those who served first and served hardest. We will open this Privilege Program to all those risking their safety, time, and comfort to support the destitute. Their service is the foundation on which Sri Lanka will rebuild. As part of this initiative, CH17 will issue a simple digital privilege card to registered responders. This electronic card will carry the volunteers name and a unique registration number. It will also include a scannable QR code and a 16-digit card number  just like a payment card number but used only for identity and fairness. When shown at participating stores, it will unlock special discounts funded entirely by merchants who wish to support caregivers. CH17 partner retailers from closed-group Privilege Networks, have been requested to accept the digital card and extend special discounts to responders during purchases. CH17 will also invite thousands more private merchants, shops and service providers to join this goodwill effort, so more volunteers can be supported in more places across the island. The entire initiative will be offered as CH17s contribution toward the national rebuilding mission led by the Rebuilding Sri Lanka Task Force. CH17 is prepared to launch the program immediately and begin issuing the first 10,000 cards under the theme Rebuild Sri Lanka. This is the first large-scale volunteer recognition and privilege support card introduced by an independent Sri Lankan organisation for disaster recovery efforts. CH17 has previously deployed a similar humanitarian recognition system during the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2021. Under the endorsement of the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health, production deployments were carried out jointly with local member-merchant nodes operated through the province-isolated Volunteer Classification Tier under the governance oversight of the Sri Lanka Health Ministry.

This delivery reflects DIMO\u2019s expanding presence in the country\u2019s container handling and logistics industry. Boasting an 8-ton lifting capacity, the newly delivered KALMAR DCU80 Empty Container Handler is specifically engineered to handle empty containers in container yards, enhancing yard management and operational efficiency. The DCU80, designed to improve space management, maximizes depot capacity and can handle a six-high stack of General Purpose (GP) containers. With its quick lifting capabilities and lowering cycles, the DCU80 dramatically increases output, boosts depot throughput, and shortens Prime Movers\u2019 turnaround times. Compared to traditional empty container handler, its new Smart Hydraulics with Load Sensing technology reduces fuel consumption and maintenance costs by supplying hydraulic power only when needed. Crucially, this also helps to reduce CO\u2082 emissions in the yard, providing container operators with an economical and environmentally friendly option. The DCU80, which was built using strong Scandinavian engineering principles, ensures reliable performance and endurance even in the harsh and demanding tropical climates, guaranteeing 24/7 operational capability. Its ergonomic and operator-centric design also encourages higher operating efficiency, increased predictability, and ease of use. Speaking of this milestone, Mr. Dimitri Sheriff, Director \u2013 Corporate Affairs of IWS Holdings Pvt Ltd, stated, \u201cIWS has trusted the KALMAR brand for decades. Partnering with DIMO as the local agent for KALMAR gives us peace of mind\u2014combining world-class equipment with excellent customer service, engineering expertise, and after-sales support. We are confident that the KALMAR DCU80 Empty Container Handler will greatly improve our yard operations and provide our customers with more value. This enables us to provide reliable, outstanding service for our clients.\u201d Commenting on the broader industry trends, Mr. Chaminda Ranawana, Executive Director of DIMO, who leads the Material Handling business in the group, said, \u201cToday, many container operators are looking for environmentally friendly ways to increase operational effectiveness. The DCU80 is an excellent example of equipment that KALMAR develops with a strong emphasis on sustainability. Compared to previous models or other manufacturers, it offers a notable reduction in fuel consumption due to its intelligent hydraulic systems and efficient powertrain. It is a great privilege for DIMO to support the goals of Sri Lanka\u2019s rapidly expanding logistics industry by bringing cutting-edge solutions that promote operational excellence and sustainability.\u201d DIMO\u2019s partnership with top brands like KALMAR highlights the company\u2019s dedication to improving Sri Lanka\u2019s logistics infrastructure and fostering a more efficient, greener future, while bringing the greatest technology from around the world to the country.

The DCU80, which was built using strong Scandinavian engineering principles, ensures reliable performance and endurance even in the harsh and demanding tropical climates, guaranteeing 247 operational capability. Its ergonomic and operator-centric design also encourages higher operating efficiency, increased predictability, and ease of use. Speaking of this milestone, Mr. Dimitri Sheriff, Director  Corporate Affairs of IWS Holdings Pvt Ltd, stated, IWS has trusted the KALMAR brand for decades. Partnering with DIMO as the local agent for KALMAR gives us peace of mindcombining world-class equipment with excellent customer service, engineering expertise, and after-sales support. We are confident that the KALMAR DCU80 Empty Container Handler will greatly improve our yard operations and provide our customers with more value. This enables us to provide reliable, outstanding service for our clients. Commenting on the broader industry trends, Mr. Chaminda Ranawana, Executive Director of DIMO, who leads the Material Handling business in the group, said, Today, many container operators are looking for environmentally friendly ways to increase operational effectiveness. The DCU80 is an excellent example of equipment that KALMAR develops with a strong emphasis on sustainability. Compared to previous models or other manufacturers, it offers a notable reduction in fuel consumption due to its intelligent hydraulic systems and efficient powertrain. It is a great privilege for DIMO to support the goals of Sri Lankas rapidly expanding logistics industry by bringing cutting-edge solutions that promote operational excellence and sustainability.

The plan is focused on a broad-based product offensive, increased electrification, new approaches to engineering and manufacturing, the adoption of new technologies, and the use of strategic partnerships to increase global unit sales and improve profitability. The plan is positioned as a bridge between the Nissan NEXT business transformation plan running from fiscal* 2020 through fiscal 2023 and Nissan Ambition 2030, the company\u2019s long-term vision. The new plan is split into mid- term imperatives for fiscal years 2024 through 2026, and mid-long-term actions to be carried out through 2030. Nissan President and Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida said: \u201cThe Arc plan shows our path to the future. It illustrates our continuous progression and ability to navigate changing market conditions. This plan will enable us to go further and faster in driving value and competitiveness. Faced with extreme market volatility, Nissan is taking decisive actions guided by the new plan to ensure sustainable growth and profitability.\u201d Under the two-part plan, Nissan will first take actions to ensure volume growth through a tailored regional strategy and prepare for an accelerated transition to EVs, supported by a balanced electrified/ICE product portfolio, volume growth in major markets and financial discipline. Through these initiatives Nissan aims to lift annual sales by 1 million units and increase its operating profit margin to more than 6%, both by the end of fiscal year 2026. This will pave the way for the second part of the plan aimed to enable the EV transition and realize long- term profitable growth, supported by smart partnerships, enhanced EV competitiveness, differentiated innovations and new revenue streams. By fiscal year 2030, Nissan sees a revenue potential of 2.5 trillion yen from new business opportunities. Nissan plans to launch 30 new models over the next three years, of which 16 will be electrified, and 14 will be ICE models, to meet the diversified customer needs in markets where the pace of electrification differs. Nissan plans to launch a total of 34 electrified models from fiscal year 2024 and 2030 to cover all segments, with the model mix of electrified vehicles expected to account for 40% globally by fiscal year 2026 and rise to 60% by the end of the decade. In key regions and markets, Nissan\u2019s actions by fiscal year 2026 (unless otherwise indicated) include: The product offensive will be supported by new development and manufacturing approaches aimed to make EVs more affordable and increase profitability. By developing EVs in families, integrating powertrains, utilizing next-generation modular manufacturing, group sourcing, and battery innovations, Nissan aims to reduce the cost of next-generation EVs by 30% (when compared to the current model Ariya crossover) and achieve cost-parity between EVs and ICE models by fiscal year 2030. In the area of family development alone, the cost of subsequent vehicles \u2013 those developed based on the main vehicle in the family \u2013 can be reduced by 50%, the variation of trim parts reduced by 70% and development lead time shortened by four months. By adopting modular manufacturing, the vehicle production line will be shortened, reducing the production time per vehicle by 20%. Under the Arc plan, more plants in Japan and overseas will adopt the Nissan Intelligent Factory concept, with the Oppama and Nissan Motor Kyushu plants in Japan, the Sunderland Plant in the UK and Canton and Smyrna plants in the U.S. starting the adoption from fiscal year 2026 through 2030. Meanwhile the EV36Zero production approach will be extended from Sunderland in the UK to plants including Canton, Decherd and Smyrna in the U.S., and Tochigi and Kyushu in Japan from fiscal year 2025 through 2028. The plan includes proposals to accelerate the evolution of vehicle intelligence technologies such as next-generation ProPILOT driver-assistance system, which realize door-to-door autonomous driving technology from on-highway to off- highway, private premises, and parking. Nissan will offer enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all solid-state batteries to provide diversified EVs to meet different customer needs. Nissan will significantly enhance NCM li-ion batteries, reducing quick-charging time by 50% and increasing energy density by 50% compared to the Ariya. LFP batteries, to be developed and produced in Japan, will be launched that will reduce cost by 30% compared to the Sakura EV minivehicle. New EVs with enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all-solid-state batteries will be launched in fiscal year 2028. Nissan will harness strategic partnerships to stay competitive and offer a global portfolio of products and technology. Nissan will continue to leverage the alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors in Europe, LATAM, ASEAN and India. In China, Nissan will fully utilize its local assets to meet the needs of China and beyond; and explore new partnerships in Japan and the U.S. Batteries will be developed and sourced with partners to bring 135 gigawatt hours of global capacity. Underpinning the plan is firm financial discipline, enabling stable CAPEX and R&D investment ratio versus net revenue of between 7% to 8% excluding battery capacity investment. Additionally, Nissan plans to invest more than 400 billion yen in battery capacity. Meanwhile, investment in electrification will increase progressively, becoming more than 70% by fiscal year 2026. Managing these investments is aimed to allow delivering benefits to all stakeholders, with Nissan maintaining positive free cash flow before M&A \u2013 even after electrification investments. This is to secure total shareholder return at more than 30%. Nissan aims to maintain net cash at a healthy level of 1 trillion yen throughout the Arc plan period. \u201cUnder this comprehensive plan we will enhance Nissan\u2019s competitiveness and achieve sustainable profitability,\u201d added Uchida. \u201cNissan is confident that it has what it takes to properly execute this plan, which will provide us with the firm foundation we need to bridge to our Nissan Ambition 2030 vision.\u201d", "content_hash": "f7bc2e298d06e2c92a93c26a19f2a1b1", "scraped_at": "2025-12-09T13:31:41.052741", "updated_at": "2025-12-09T13:31:41.052749", "update_count": 0, "text_cleaned": "Nissan to strengthen product portfolio, advance electrification, introduce new ways of developing and manufacturing, and harness partnerships to achieve Ambition 2030 vision YOKOHAMA, Japan Nissan Motor Co., Ltd, today launched The Arc, its new business plan to drive value and strengthen competitiveness.

In the area of family development alone, the cost of subsequent vehicles  those developed based on the main vehicle in the family  can be reduced by 50, the variation of trim parts reduced by 70 and development lead time shortened by four months. By adopting modular manufacturing, the vehicle production line will be shortened, reducing the production time per vehicle by 20. Under the Arc plan, more plants in Japan and overseas will adopt the Nissan Intelligent Factory concept, with the Oppama and Nissan Motor Kyushu plants in Japan, the Sunderland Plant in the UK and Canton and Smyrna plants in the U.S. starting the adoption from fiscal year 2026 through 2030. Meanwhile the EV36Zero production approach will be extended from Sunderland in the UK to plants including Canton, Decherd and Smyrna in the U.S., and Tochigi and Kyushu in Japan from fiscal year 2025 through 2028. The plan includes proposals to accelerate the evolution of vehicle intelligence technologies such as next-generation ProPILOT driver-assistance system, which realize door-to-door autonomous driving technology from on-highway to off- highway, private premises, and parking. Nissan will offer enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all solid-state batteries to provide diversified EVs to meet different customer needs. Nissan will significantly enhance NCM li-ion batteries, reducing quick-charging time by 50 and increasing energy density by 50 compared to the Ariya. LFP batteries, to be developed and produced in Japan, will be launched that will reduce cost by 30 compared to the Sakura EV minivehicle. New EVs with enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all-solid-state batteries will be launched in fiscal year 2028. Nissan will harness strategic partnerships to stay competitive and offer a global portfolio of products and technology. Nissan will continue to leverage the alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors in Europe, LATAM, ASEAN and India. In China, Nissan will fully utilize its local assets to meet the needs of China and beyond and explore new partnerships in Japan and the U.S. Batteries will be developed and sourced with partners to bring 135 gigawatt hours of global capacity. Underpinning the plan is firm financial discipline, enabling stable CAPEX and RD investment ratio versus net revenue of between 7 to 8 excluding battery capacity investment. Additionally, Nissan plans to invest more than 400 billion yen in battery capacity. Meanwhile, investment in electrification will increase progressively, becoming more than 70 by fiscal year 2026. Managing these investments is aimed to allow delivering benefits to all stakeholders, with Nissan maintaining positive free cash flow before MA  even after electrification investments. This is to secure total shareholder return at more than 30. Nissan aims to maintain net cash at a healthy level of 1 trillion yen throughout the Arc plan period. Under this comprehensive plan we will enhance Nissans competitiveness and achieve sustainable profitability, added Uchida.

The Bank\u2019s Development Credit Department, together with its Kaduruwela Branch, recently hosted the inaugural awareness programme titled \u201cEnhancing Paddy Productivity and Farmer Livelihoods through Adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and High-Tech Agriculture in the Polonnaruwa District.\u201d Held at the Agbo Hotel, Giritale, the event brought together more than 120 farmers from eight divisional areas, representing the district\u2019s diverse agricultural communities. This initiative is part of Commercial Bank\u2019s broader vision to drive national food security , empower the rural economy , and support farmers through knowledge-sharing and sustainable agricultural solutions that foster long-term economic resilience. This initiative was designed to address the persistent productivity gap in local paddy cultivation. While Polonnaruwa\u2019s average yield currently stands at around 4.5 metric tonnes per hectare, agricultural experts estimate the potential yield at approximately six metric tonnes. To help bridge this gap, the programme focused on creating awareness about modern cultivation methods, responsible use of agro-chemicals, mechanisation, financial management, and environmental sustainability. Among those who addressed the gathering were representatives of the Bank, the Department of Agriculture, the Eastern University, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka \u2013 North Central Region, A. Baur & Co. and Browns Agriculture. The sessions covered key topics such as the adoption of GAP principles, high-tech agricultural techniques, sustainable use of agro-inputs, and new technologies in paddy machinery. The Bank said the initiative aims to position Polonnaruwa as a model district for sustainable, GAP-based paddy cultivation. It also seeks to promote financial inclusion among rural communities by connecting farmers with formal banking channels and customised financial solutions to fund mechanisation, crop diversification, and value-added processing. Speaking about the programme, Mrs Mithila Shamini, Assistant General Manager \u2013 Personal Banking/SME at Commercial Bank said: \u201cAgriculture is the backbone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, and its transformation is central to our nation\u2019s food security and rural prosperity.

This milestone is a testament to the trust placed in us by riders, driver partners, and local communities. Sri Lanka is a key part of our growth story, and our focus for the next decade is on deepening our presence, expanding access to affordable and reliable transportation, and continuing to be a platform of choice for earning opportunities. We remain committed to investing in partnerships and people to serve Sri Lanka even better in the years to come. Recognizing drivers for their contribution To mark this milestone, Uber announced a free financial literacy programme for Sri Lankan drivers in partnership with Hatton National Bank HNB, with an initial pilot covering 1000 drivers. The programme will equip earners with essential skills in personal financial budgeting and management, providing an understanding of options available for investment and saving, helping them build greater stability and confidence. Uber recognised 10 outstanding drivers for their professionalism, consistency and contributions to keeping Sri Lanka moving  celebrating longest-serving and most engaged drivers who have shaped the countrys mobility ecosystem over the last ten years.

Our financial literacy initiative and the recognition of outstanding partners reflect our commitment to ensuring drivers are equipped for long-term success, and a step closer to meeting their life goals.

Supporting the community As Sri Lanka recovers from the impact of Cyclone Ditwah, Uber has committed LKR 65 million to the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society to support relief and recovery for affected communities. This includes funding for dry rations, medicines and care packs, free Uber rides for Red Cross teams, and support through Uber Eats to source and deliver essential supplies. Uber has also partnered with the Colombo Municipal Council CMC to run a public Donation Drive, enabling Sri Lankans to use the Uber app to send dry rations and essential items directly to the Town Hall collection point at no cost. The latest efforts follow Ubers continued partnership with Red Cross to support the community. During the economic crisis, Uber had donated LKR 60 million to help vulnerable communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Uber donated 50,000 free rides for transporting frontline healthcare workers, elderly and citizens from vulnerable communities to vaccination hubs. As Uber enters its next decade in Sri Lanka, the company remains committed to expanding mobility access, strengthening earning opportunities, and standing with the community in moments of need  continuing to move Sri Lanka forward, one trip at a time.

Speaking at the event, Dr. Shiromani Edirimanne, Additional Secretary Agri-technology, of the Ministry of Agriculture said, This project has been designed to address the present issues of Sri Lankas fruit value chains through consultations with all relevant partners. This programme represents a significant milestone in the development of Sri Lankas fruit production sector and is a testament to the strong partnership between Sri Lanka and China through FAO Sri Lanka. All stakeholders including farmers, processors, and traders have a shared interest in improving the quality of fruit produced in Sri Lanka. Prioritizing interventions such as these will lead to more efficient, resilient, and sustainable fruit value chains that are able to withstand not only environmental shocks but market uncertainties as well, FAOs Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Vimlendra Sharan said speaking at the event. Sri Lanka has a rich diversity of fruits with approximately 100 edible fruit crops. However, the fruit sector remains underdeveloped. As a result, the sector suffers from poor cultivation and high post-harvest losses leading to low yield and inadequate adherence to international quality standards. This project aims to address such concerns and strengthen the fruit value chains in the domestic as well as export markets.", "sentiment_score": 0.122, "sentiment_label": "positive", "entities": {"PERSON": ["Anuradhapura", "Anping Ye", "Lin Huifang", "Shiromani Edirimanne", "Vimlendra Sharan"], "ORG": ["Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO", "USD", "Ministry of Agriculture", "riangular Cooperation Division", "Fruit Research Development Institute FRDI", "National Institute of Post-Harvest Management NIPHM of Sri Lanka", "Foreign Economic Cooperation Center FECC of", "Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs", "Maldives"], "GPE": ["China", "Sri Lanka", "Colombo", "Kalutara", "Gampaha", "Monaragala", "banana"], "LOC": ["the South-South Cooperation SSC", "South-South"]}, "keywords": ["this project", "the expert team", "the event", "the establishment", "part", "the quality", "the national institute", "the global market", "the project", "the important role", "market uncertainties", "sri lanka", "additional secretary agri-technology", "rural affairs", "the project preparation"], "sectors": ["agriculture"], "language": "en", "word_count": 493, "enriched_at": "2025-12-09T13:54:00.612285"}, "182": {"source": "EconomicTimes.lk", "section": "economy", "title": "Sri Lanka plans to build the first nuclear power plant by 2032 with Russian support", "url": "https://economictimes.lk/index.php/2023/05/22/sri-lanka-plans-to-build-the-first-nuclear-power-plant-by-2032-with-russian-support/", "text": "The Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board stated in the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy and Transport that if all activities go as planned, the first nuclear power plant can be built in Sri Lanka by 2032 with Russian technical support.

On Friday, the Under Secretary\u2019s discussions affirmed Sri Lanka\u2019s key role as a priority country in the 2024 Food for Progress initiative, which focuses on enhancing food security and climate resilience through environmentally friendly practices and improved market linkages. A primary focus was the ongoing $27.5 million Market-Oriented Dairy Project which has helped improve milk productivity for over 15,000 dairy farmers in Sri Lanka, with many reporting doubling production thanks to the project.\u00a0 USDA\u2019s dairy project also seeks to help improve climate adaptivity among the dairy farmers by providing comprehensive training on cattle herding and feed consumption strategies that reduce unnecessary energy consumption. Additionally, since 2018 the USDA\u2019s McGovern-Dole project implemented by Save the Children in partnership with the Ministry of Education has provided daily meals to close to 100,000 Sri Lankan primary schoolchildren throughout the country.\u00a0 Building on this success, USDA embarked on a new five-year, $32.5 million project expansion to further boost school meal provisions across eight districts, including Badulla, Colombo, Kilinochchi, Monaragala, Mullaitivu, Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, and Trincomalee.

Under Secretary Taylors visit underscored the American peoples ongoing commitment to supporting the agricultural development and economic growth of Sri Lanka, promoting greater food security and enhancing resilience against climate challenges. On Friday, the Under Secretarys discussions affirmed Sri Lankas key role as a priority country in the 2024 Food for Progress initiative, which focuses on enhancing food security and climate resilience through environmentally friendly practices and improved market linkages. A primary focus was the ongoing 27.5 million Market-Oriented Dairy Project which has helped improve milk productivity for over 15,000 dairy farmers in Sri Lanka, with many reporting doubling production thanks to the project. USDAs dairy project also seeks to help improve climate adaptivity among the dairy farmers by providing comprehensive training on cattle herding and feed consumption strategies that reduce unnecessary energy consumption. Additionally, since 2018 the USDAs McGovern-Dole project implemented by Save the Children in partnership with the Ministry of Education has provided daily meals to close to 100,000 Sri Lankan primary schoolchildren throughout the country. Building on this success, USDA embarked on a new five-year, 32.5 million project expansion to further boost school meal provisions across eight districts, including Badulla, Colombo, Kilinochchi, Monaragala, Mullaitivu, Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, and Trincomalee.

This figure was 29% in Q4 2023 , and Coveware\u2019s stats show that diminishing payments have remained steady since early 2019. This decrease is due to organizations implementing more advanced protective measures, mounting legal pressure not to meet the crooks\u2019 financial demands, and cybercriminals repeatedly breaching promises not to publish or resale stolen data if a ransom is paid. However, it is essential to note that despite the drop in the payment rate, the amount paid to ransomware actors is higher than ever before, reaching $1.1 billion last year , according to a Chainalysis report. This is due to ransomware gangs hitting more organizations by escalating their attack frequency and demanding more substantial figures for not exposing stolen secrets and providing victims with a decryption key. Concerning Q1 2024, Coveware reports a 32% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) drop in the average ransom payment, now at $381,980, and a 25% QoQ increase in the median ransom payment, which stands at $250,000. This simultaneous drop in average and rise in median ransom payments indicates a decrease in high-figure payments and an increase in moderate amounts. This could be caused by ransom demands becoming more modest and/or fewer high-value targets succumbing to extortion. Regarding initial infiltration methods, there\u2019s a\u00a0rising number of cases where this is unknown, reaching nearly half of all reported cases in the first quarter of 2024.

The fiscal deficit is set to be wider than our current forecast of 7.1% of GDP in 2024 in light of the new data, even after excluding bank recapitalization costs, and the revenue/GDP ratio would be lower than Fitch had assumed earlier. The government is targeting a budget deficit of 9.1% of GDP in 2024, wider than a revised estimate of 8.5% in 2023. However, without bank recapitalization costs, the deficit in 2024 would be a narrower 7.6% of GDP. Excluding recapitalization costs, the budget targets a primary surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 2024, against a deficit of 0.7% in 2023. However, including recapitalization costs pushes the 2024 primary deficit target to 0.6% of GDP. The primary surplus goal for 2024, excluding bank recapitalization, is broadly in line with the 0.8% of GDP projected by the IMF in March when it approved Sri Lanka\u2019s USD3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Fitch also see the revenue target as relatively aligned. However, the government\u2019s expenditure target for 2024, at 22.2% of GDP, is somewhat higher than the 19.7% the IMF had envisioned and well above the revised budget estimate of 18.7% for 2023. The release of the next tranche of EFF financing, worth around USD330 million, will depend partly on the IMF\u2019s assessment of Sri Lanka\u2019s progress in securing financing assurances from official creditors. Fitch believes there has been some progress since March, but the timeline for a restructuring deal with official creditors remains unclear.  Fitch believes there are significant risks to the government\u2019s revenue goal for 2024. Sri Lanka has a record of fiscal slippage, and revenue collection fell 29% short of target over 9M23. The authorities aim to raise revenue by almost 45% in 2024. This will be aided by a planned 3pp increase in the value-added tax to 18%, but the boost to revenue from inflation is set to weaken in 2024. The Rating agency project consumer prices will rise by 8.7% on average in 2024, compared with 22.1% in 2023. The lift from economic growth, which Fitch projects at 3.3% in 2024, will also be modest. Downside risks to revenue could be offset by lower-than-budgeted spending. We think the presidential election in late 2024 will incentivise the government to keep to its spending plans, which include a 14% increase in spending on salaries and wages. Nevertheless, if revenue falls short, there may be some room to trim capital expenditure, which amounts to almost 20% of total planned spending and is budgeted to rise 55% in 2024, excluding bank recapitalisation. The government\u2019s efforts to implement governance reform after a recent diagnostic study by the IMF may also support revenue collection.

The fiscal deficit is set to be wider than our current forecast of 7.1 of GDP in 2024 in light of the new data, even after excluding bank recapitalization costs, and the revenueGDP ratio would be lower than Fitch had assumed earlier. The government is targeting a budget deficit of 9.1 of GDP in 2024, wider than a revised estimate of 8.5 in 2023. However, without bank recapitalization costs, the deficit in 2024 would be a narrower 7.6 of GDP. Excluding recapitalization costs, the budget targets a primary surplus of 0.8 of GDP in 2024, against a deficit of 0.7 in 2023. However, including recapitalization costs pushes the 2024 primary deficit target to 0.6 of GDP. The primary surplus goal for 2024, excluding bank recapitalization, is broadly in line with the 0.8 of GDP projected by the IMF in March when it approved Sri Lankas USD3 billion Extended Fund Facility EFF. Fitch also see the revenue target as relatively aligned. However, the governments expenditure target for 2024, at 22.2 of GDP, is somewhat higher than the 19.7 the IMF had envisioned and well above the revised budget estimate of 18.7 for 2023.

Hon. Ajith Mannapperuma, Chair of the Committee, pointed out that the main expectation of these discussions is to work to restore the prestigious name of Sri Lankan gems among foreign countries and to get foreign exchange from the export and re-export of gems. Officials representing the Ministry of Finance pointed out that an amended Bill has already been submitted to Parliament to exempt the process from the 2.5% social security tax imposed on the importation of gems for re-export, and the relief is to be given to businessmen in the future. It was also revealed that even if you have to pay a tax of 2.5% while importing gems for re-export by courier, you can bring a lot of precious gems as hand luggage by paying only 200 US dollars.

In order to avoid the tax levied by the government on cash transactions of more than Rs.500,000/=, the gem businessmen in the field are often tempted to carry out such high value cash transactions in cash and as a result, the businessmen who transact money fairly through banks and pay taxes properly to the government have to leave the field.

MoF presented the fiscal status as of the end of June 2023. According to this report, the primary balance of the budget had a surplus of 0.1%. Revenue collection has increased by 41.9% YoY to 1,317 Bn, mainly as a result of the substantial increase in VAT on goods and services. Expenditure for the first half was 2,560 Bn, which witnessed an increase of 40.5% YoY. The biggest increase was in domestic interest expense, which rose by 51.6% to 1,273 Bn in the first half of this year.

Key concerns raised by the member of COPF were regarding the 11.5 percent contraction in the first quarter of 2023. The Committee questioned the root causes of such contraction and the specific measures taken to address such root causes preventing further economic downturns The Committee further questioned the sustainable plan of the Ministry to achieve growth in line with the Hon.

The Committee was of the notion that the response to the Committee queries by the officials who were present, was ineffective and in lacks clarity. The Committee also queried the increase of taxes due naturally to inflation vs policy changes in taxes.

Revenue collection has increased by 41.9 YoY to 1,317 Bn, mainly as a result of the substantial increase in VAT on goods and services. Expenditure for the first half was 2,560 Bn, which witnessed an increase of 40.5 YoY. The biggest increase was in domestic interest expense, which rose by 51.6 to 1,273 Bn in the first half of this year. The Committee members raised various questions regarding the fiscal position, Economic performance, expenditure, and the performance of the state-owned enterprises based on the statistics presented by the officials present. Key concerns raised by the member of COPF were regarding the 11.5 percent contraction in the first quarter of 2023. The Committee questioned the root causes of such contraction and the specific measures taken to address such root causes preventing further economic downturns The Committee further questioned the sustainable plan of the Ministry to achieve growth in line with the Hon. Presidents Vision 2048. Though there was a substantial discussion on the plan for growth to reach a developed country, it was disclosed that there was no coherent strategy. The Committee was of the notion that the response to the Committee queries by the officials who were present, was ineffective and in lacks clarity. The Committee also queried the increase of taxes due naturally to inflation vs policy changes in taxes. Whilst expressing the importance of being prepared with adequate data and statistics when presenting before the Committee, COPF also emphasized that the officials of the Ministry of Finance should be more responsible and have a proper vision along with a focused team to achieve the goal of a sustainable economy.", "sentiment_score": 0.098, "sentiment_label": "neutral", "entities": {"PERSON": ["Harsha de Silva"], "ORG": ["Committee on Public Finance", "Committee", "Parliament", "Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report", "Minister of Finance", "National Policies", "MoF", "YoY", "VAT", "COPF"], "GPE": [], "LOC": []}, "keywords": ["finance", "adequate data", "key concerns", "economic stabilization", "an increase", "the committee meeting", "the end", "the budget", "the member", "40.5 yoy.", "taxes", "the plan", "lacks", "policy changes", "2,560 bn"], "sectors": ["government"], "language": "en", "word_count": 414, "enriched_at": "2025-12-09T13:55:43.472343"}, "221": {"source": "EconomicTimes.lk", "section": "economy", "title": "Central Bank releases a Pamphlet on Monetary Policy Implementation in Sri Lanka", "url": "https://economictimes.lk/index.php/2023/07/17/central-bank-releases-a-pamphlet-on-monetary-policy-implementation-in-sri-lanka/", "text": "The Central Bank has released a pamphlet on \u2018Monetary Policy Implementation in Sri Lanka\u2019 in all three languages, with the aim of enhancing awareness of the general public on the role of the Central Bank in the implementation of monetary policy in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has been a country that has followed this trend repetitively, having entered into 16 economic stabilisation programmes during 1965-2020, and recently entered into its 17th economic stabilisation programme with the IMF. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) estimates in 2019 (prior to the pandemic and crisis), showed that Sri Lanka needed to spend an additional 9 per cent of GDP per year to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. While the National Budget for 2023 aims to reduce the budget deficit from 10.2 per cent of GDP in 2022 to 7.9 per cent in 2023, mainly financed through domestic sources. This could limit the resources available for climate and sustainability-related interventions, and put pressure for higher interest rates. The country faces significant climate change risks as well. The global climate risk index for 2021, ranked Sri Lanka as the 23rd most affected country from extreme weather conditions during the period of 2000\u20132019. The country is also expected to see a 1.2 per cent annual GDP loss by 2050 due to effects of climate change. Therefore, moving into a conventional IMF agreement may not reap the full benefits required for Sri Lanka. In parallel to the IMF programme and negotiations with other multilateral agencies, alternative financing mechanisms should be explored in order to achieve Sri Lanka\u2019s development goals while overcoming the debt overhang. Alternative financing mechanisms, if effectively implemented, have the potential to provide long-term credit benefits by offering debt relief while also increasing investments that could strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s resilience to environmental risks. This can be a win-win situation for the country to achieve debt sustainability as well promote economic development in the country. Alternative Financing Options The Government of Sri Lanka has currently embarked on capacity development programmes for the adoption of alternative financing mechanisms such as green bonds. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) too has developed a policy and regulatory framework governing green bonds and in April 2023, the SEC approved rules for issuing green bonds for listed companies and statutory entities. This was subsequent to the publication of the green finance taxonomy by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which provided clarity on economic activities that are environmentally sustainable. Therefore, the landscape for adopting alternative financing mechanisms is being created, enabling a favorable environment for the use of alternative financing mechanisms in the future. An array of solutions can be considered for Sri Lanka, some of which are more appropriate than others in the country context and government priorities. Debt-for-climate or debt-for-sustainability swaps have proven to be a successful debt alleviation tool globally while promoting investment in green and sustainable projects. Carbon credits too can be a feasible and innovative way to address debt overhang and climate change simultaneously but requires more research on the impacts and scalability. Concessional and blended finance models too can provide favourable results while linking these to development objectives of Sri Lanka. In the long term, thematic bonds are also a tool that can be used to mobilise domestic and foreign capital. However, prior to a thematic bond issuance, access to the international finance markets should be established. This is expected to be facilitated by the completion of the IMF programme: A) Debt-for-Climate or Debt-for-Sustainability Swaps This is a financial instrument where the country would swap a promise (repayments on debt) with another promise (such as funding SDGs). Recently, in the aftermath of Sri Lanka\u2019s default, a global financial firm too expressed interest in restructuring USD 1 billion of debt for environmental purposes. Under a bilateral debt swap a debtor country and a creditor involve the cancellation or reduction of a portion of the debt in exchange for the debtor\u2019s commitment to invest in sustainability projects. For example, Sri Lanka could look to negotiate with China (one of its largest bilateral creditors), to swap some of its debt for investments in protecting its forests, wetlands and coral reefs, which are rich in biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services. This would reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s debt burden and free up fiscal space for other development priorities, while also enhancing its resilience. Other Country Experience In 2021, Belize swapped USD 553 million (total external commercial debt) through a blue bond arranged by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to the Belize government to finance a bond-for-cash exchange at 55 cents per dollar. This was in exchange for a 20-year commitment to expand and strengthen its marine protected area. The US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance for the blue bond. In 2022, Barbados swapped USD 150 million of sovereign debt with guarantees from the Inter- American Development Bank (IDB) and TNC to protect 30 per cent of the waters surrounding the island following a similar model of Belize. In 2023, Ecuador swapped USD 1.6 billion of the country\u2019s debt for conservation in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. To date, this is the largest debt-for-nature swap completed in the world. It consisted of an USD 85 million IDB guarantee and an USD 656 million DFC political-risk insurance. B) Carbon Credits Carbon credits are certificates that represent a reduction or avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions. It allows countries or entities that reduce their emissions below a certain level to sell their surplus emission reductions (or carbon credits) to countries or entities that need to comply with their emission targets or voluntarily offset their emissions. This can lower the cost of compliance for buyers and generate additional income for sellers. The Paris Agreement has introduced a new mechanism for international cooperation on climate action, known as Article 6. This mechanism allows countries to cooperate in achieving their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) through various approaches, such as bilateral or multilateral agreements, or carbon pricing instruments.

According to the World Energy Investment report, the global energy crisis that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine , as well as the growing affordability of renewables , has given rise to more sustainable alternatives, sparking a rise in investments. \u201cClean energy is moving fast \u2013 faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol in an IEA press release . \u201cFor every dollar invested in fossil fuels, about 1.7 dollars are now going into clean energy. Five years ago, this ratio was one-to-one. One shining example is investment in solar, which is set to overtake the amount of investment going into oil production for the first time.\u201d In 2023, approximately $2.8 trillion will be invested in energy globally, the report said. More than $1.7 trillion of that amount is projected to be invested in green energy technologies like electric vehicles (EVs), renewables, power grids, nuclear energy , heat pumps , low-emissions fuels and improvements in energy efficiency. The remaining more than $1 trillion will be invested in gas , oil and coal . Yearly investments in renewables are predicted to increase by 24 percent from 2021 to 2023, while fossil fuel investments are expected to rise just 15 percent. Advanced economies, as well as China , are responsible for more than 90 percent of the growth, which could jeopardize global energy equality if green energy investment increases aren\u2019t seen in other parts of the world. \u201cWeak grid infrastructure is a limiting factor for renewable investment in many developing economies, and here too current investment flows are highly concentrated. Advanced economies and China account for 80% of global spending and for almost all of the growth in recent years,\u201d the report said. Renewable energy technologies are projected to make up nearly 90 percent of power generation investment this year, led by solar energy . Investments in solar are expected to reach more than $1 billion per day this year, for a total of $382 billion in 2023, reported Reuters. Oil production investment is projected to be $371 billion. \u201cThis crowns solar as a true energy superpower. It is emerging as the biggest tool we have for rapid decarbonisation of the entire economy,\u201d said Dave Jones, energy think tank Ember\u2019s head of data insights, as Reuters reported. EV sales are projected to rise by one-third in 2023, following a jump last year, the press release said. Since 2021, sales of heat pumps worldwide have also grown by double digits. New initiatives like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and policies in Europe, China, Japan and other countries, as well as phases of vigorous economic growth coupled with unstable fossil fuel prices have helped prompt investments in clean energy. Oil and gas upstream spending is projected to increase by seven percent this year, primarily by large Middle Eastern national oil companies. New fossil fuel investments will increase by six percent to $950 billion this year, according to the IEA report. The increase in fossil fuel investments will lead to levels this year that are more than twice where they need to be in 2030 to be on track for the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario laid out by the IEA, the press release said. Last year, demand for coal was at a record high. In 2023, investment in coal is on a trajectory for a six-fold increase over the levels forecast to reach net zero goals for 2030. \u201cInvestment in coal supply is expected to rise by 10% in 2023, and is already well above pre-pandemic levels.

Higher interest rates, weak grid infrastructure, high capital costs, obscure policy rules and strained utilities have hampered investments in renewables in those countries. \u201cThe irony remains that some of the sunniest places in the world have the lowest levels of solar investment,\u201d Jones said, as reported by Reuters.

Coupled with high humidity, the high temperatures make people uncomfortable and sweaty. This year, the Department of Meteorology went so far as to issue heat warnings for several districts, cautioning residents against exposure to high heat that can have harmful health implications. As neighboring South Asian countries are scorched by a severe heat wave, the unusually high-temperature rise is impacting people and their daily lives, a change that causes worry among locals about climate risk. \u201cAs the temperature has risen to about 36 degrees Celsius [96.8 degrees Fahrenheit], Sri Lanka has experienced about 3 degrees Celsius [5.4 degrees Fahrenheit] increase of the daily maximum temperature during the recent heat stress period,\u201d says Shiromani Jayawardena , the deputy director of the Department of Meteorology . Exposure to excessive heat along with high humidity may prove stressful to the body and in extreme cases can even kill, so the department assesses the situation and issues warnings to the public to remain cautious, Jayawardena said. This year, an unusual heat wave with high temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius impacted South and Central Asia. As Sri Lanka is an island, it did not have the same impacts as neighboring countries, but climate models project risks of similar heat waves after 2030 under emission projections, Jayawardena told Mongabay. Increased heat stress is an indication of climate change, and a recent study found that deadly heat stress is becoming a common occurrence across South Asia even with 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) global warming. Lareef Zubair , a scientist at the Foundation for Environment, Climate, and Technology ( FECT ) said heat stress in Sri Lanka is rising to dangerous levels for a larger share of the population due to climate change. Sri Lankans are now experiencing more warm nights\u00a0compared with cold nights. A study found that annually averaged mean minimum temperatures are increasing, reducing the gap between maximum and minimum temperatures. Temperatures in Sri Lanka have been rising faster than the global average at about 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.24 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade, Zubair said. \u201cBy 2019, 2020 and 2022, The heat stress reached risk levels particularly in low elevation parts of Sri Lanka from April to June and this is a clear indication of the role of warming temperatures,\u201d Zubair said. The data also indicate that the number of days the heat index reaches \u201cextreme caution\u201d levels is on the rise, the climate scientist said. Urbanized areas are more prone to excessive heat due to the heat island effect in which human activities make the urban environment significantly warmer than rural areas, said Erandathie Lokupitiya , a professor of environmental science at the University of Colombo. \u201cIn an urban setting, there are buildings, tarred roads and cemented pavements which can absorb heat and then release them,\u201d she said. Studies also show how the heat in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial capital, has risen over time. In this era of climate change, cities should be designed strategically to mitigate increasing threats emanating from heat stresses, said Jagath Munasinghe , an urban planner at the University of Moratuwa. \u201cThere are wind corridors that can help to naturally cool the urban environment, reducing the heat through a natural windfall.

The plants are nature\u2019s air purifiers, as their evaporation adds water vapor to the atmosphere. But urban areas are rapidly losing greenery, making them unhealthy and uncomfortable to live in, so regreening cities should become a priority, Munasinghe said. \u201cTrees can be planted along the wind corridors, so the air will get naturally cool,\u201d Munasinghe said. Greening cities has multiple advantages, but vegetation should be planted well based on a feasibility study to make it sustainable, he added. Not only humans but animals, plants and ecosystems should brace for the inevitable impacts from increased heat stress. \u201cThe impact would be more for smaller animals; for example, it is estimated that a small increase in temperature could wipe out some insects and sensitive animals,\u201d Lokupitiya said. However, corals may be the most impacted by such heat stress, as higher ocean temperatures can make corals bleach and die. \u201cMay and June are the months when corals get bleached due to increased temperature resulting from extreme heat. These delicate organisms get severely impacted by heat stress,\u201d said Arjan Rajasuriya , a coral scientist and a former researcher at the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency . Some corals revive and are resilient to heat stress, but in a prolonged event, more corals bleach. The impact could be worse for corals in shallower seas and those in areas where water is stagnated, Rajasuriya added. Sri Lanka needs more research to analyze the possible impacts of such heat stress and overall impacts of climate change, said Devaka Weerakoon , fauna coordinator for the IUCN Red List. The impacts of the changing climate could be greater along the borders of the country\u2019s climatic zones, so more studies are required to project the possible impacts of climate change on living organisms, Weerakoon told Mongabay.

Coupled with high humidity, the high temperatures make people uncomfortable and sweaty. This year, the Department of Meteorology went so far as to issue heat warnings for several districts, cautioning residents against exposure to high heat that can have harmful health implications. As neighboring South Asian countries are scorched by a severe heat wave, the unusually high-temperature rise is impacting people and their daily lives, a change that causes worry among locals about climate risk. As the temperature has risen to about 36 degrees Celsius 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit, Sri Lanka has experienced about 3 degrees Celsius 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit increase of the daily maximum temperature during the recent heat stress period, says Shiromani Jayawardena , the deputy director of the Department of Meteorology . Exposure to excessive heat along with high humidity may prove stressful to the body and in extreme cases can even kill, so the department assesses the situation and issues warnings to the public to remain cautious, Jayawardena said. This year, an unusual heat wave with high temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius impacted South and Central Asia. As Sri Lanka is an island, it did not have the same impacts as neighboring countries, but climate models project risks of similar heat waves after 2030 under emission projections, Jayawardena told Mongabay. Increased heat stress is an indication of climate change, and a recent study found that deadly heat stress is becoming a common occurrence across South Asia even with 1.5 degrees Celsius 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit global warming. Lareef Zubair , a scientist at the Foundation for Environment, Climate, and Technology  FECT  said heat stress in Sri Lanka is rising to dangerous levels for a larger share of the population due to climate change. Sri Lankans are now experiencing more warm nights compared with cold nights. A study found that annually averaged mean minimum temperatures are increasing, reducing the gap between maximum and minimum temperatures. Temperatures in Sri Lanka have been rising faster than the global average at about 1.8 degrees Celsius 3.24 degrees Fahrenheit per decade, Zubair said.
