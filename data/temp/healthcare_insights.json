BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS (2-3 sentences):**\n\n*   **Government Policy Shift:** The increased focus on disaster preparedness necessitates revised risk assessments, better resource allocation, and strengthening coordination among government agencies (health, disaster management, etc.).\n*   **Investment in Infrastructure & Training:** Businesses should proactively invest in modernizing healthcare facilities, training personnel, and establishing robust emergency response plans.\n*   **Strategic Partnerships:**  Companies can benefit from fostering partnerships with international organizations like Morison and Indian authorities to leverage expertise and resources.  Focus on long-term strategic investments, not just short-term aid, for sustainable recovery.\n*   **Enhanced Reputation & Public Trust:** Demonstrating a proactive and compassionate approach through CSR initiatives can significantly boost Sri Lanka's reputation as a responsible nation, attracting investment and boosting consumer confidence.\n\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to:\n\n*   Expand on any of these themes?\n*   Provide a more detailed SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)?\n*   Focus on a specific aspect (e.g., the role of healthcare professionals)?",
