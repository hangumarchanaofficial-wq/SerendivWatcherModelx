The suspension, which took effect on December 5, 2025 and will remain in force until December 26, 2025, was issued under the provisions of Regulation of Insurance Industry Act No. 43 of 2000. The regulatory body cited severe infractions as the basis for the suspension, accusing the insurer of conducting business in a manner detrimental to the interests of the policyholders and national interest. In a disclosure to the Colombo Stock Exchange, the company admitted that the regulator found it unable to meet the specified solvency margin, a critical financial metric required to ensure an insurer can pay out the future claims. Furthermore, the IRCSL stated that the company failed to follow the legal provisions and regulatory orders and accused it of providing false, inaccurate and misleading data while concealing the material facts. This regulatory action stands in sharp contrast to the optimistic image projected in the company\u2019s recent financial reporting. Just weeks prior to the suspension, Sanasa Life released its condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2025, under the title \u2018The Unshaken Light\u2019. While these unaudited statements reported a profit for the period, they also revealed a retained earnings deficit of Rs.59 million for the group, hinting at an underlying financial strain, despite the positive branding. The suspension also challenges the narrative of stability presented in the company\u2019s 2024 annual report titled \u2018Beacon of Resilience\u2019. In that report, Sanasa Life claimed a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 169 percent for its life insurance business, well above the regulatory minimum and positioned itself as an \u201cunwavering\u201d protector for its 560,000 customers. The regulator\u2019s recent findings regarding insolvency and data manipulation now cast doubt on the accuracy of those prior assertions of financial health. Sanasa Life Insurance, which was established in 1991 and operates through a network of 191 branches, has long marketed itself as a leader in microinsurance, aimed at uplifting the grassroots communities. The suspension notice was formally communicated to the exchange by CEO Nuwanpriya Gunawardena, who acknowledged the regulator\u2019s directive. As the suspension period progresses, the company faces the critical task of addressing these solvency and compliance failures to regain its licence to operate.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

The proposals, submitted by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as the Finance, Planning and Economic Development Minister, aim to fund the immediate relief efforts and expedite the long-term post-disaster recovery, following the extreme floods and landslides that impacted the island. Under the first approval, the government will activate \u201cemergency response components\u201d within the existing investment projects funded by the World Bank Cluster. This mechanism allows the state to redirect funds toward urgent infrastructure rebuilding. The Cabinet has authorised the government to obtain a total ranging between US $ 92 million and US $ 112 million through this facility. These funds will be directed toward a comprehensive recovery framework, prioritising the rehabilitation of agricultural lands, livelihoods and essential public facilities destroyed by the cyclone. Separately, the Cabinet approved entering into an agreement with the ADB to receive a US $ 3 million grant, under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. The government requested this assistance to restore the life security services immediately following the disaster. The grant is specifically earmarked for supplying the materials required to provide the essential safety and support services to the affected communities. The funding comes in the wake of Cyclone Ditwah, which the authorities have described as one of the most ferocious natural calamities in the recent past. The extreme weather conditions resulted in severe floods and landslides, causing loss of life, displacement of communities and extensive destruction to the country\u2019s infrastructure.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

Last month, GovPay rolled out the online traffic fine payment scheme in the North Western and North Central provinces, following training and awareness sessions for the officers from all police stations in both provinces. Organised by the Sri Lanka Police and conducted by the officials from LankaPay and the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), the sessions aimed to educate the traffic police officers on how citizens can make payments via GovPay. With this expansion, the citizens in five of the country\u2019s provinces can now settle traffic fines via the government digital payment platform. GovPay is a collaborative initiative between the ICTA and LankaPay, the national financial transaction network. It was launched in February this year, under the guidance of the Digital Economy Ministry. The platform was designed to streamline the public service delivery by allowing the citizens to complete government-related payments\u2014including fines, taxes, bills and other service charges\u2014digitally. According to a social media post from LankaPay, GovPay traffic spot fine payments were introduced to enhance the public service delivery through digitalisation. Moreover, online traffic fine payments have become the digital payment platform\u2019s biggest contributor in terms of transaction count. Traffic fines can be paid through the online and mobile banking platforms of 14 banks and six fintech applications. These include BOC Flex, Sampath Vishwa, HNB Digital Banking and SOLO, NSB Pay, People\u2019s Pay, ComBank Digital, DFCC Online Banking, Nations Direct Online Banking, NDB NEOS Online Banking, NSB Online Banking, Pan Asia Online Banking, SDB Internet Banking, Seylan Online Banking, LB Finance CIM, WEBXPAY, FriMi, Genie, Helakuru and iPay. By the end of this year, LankaPay hopes to roll out the GovPay traffic fine payment scheme throughout the island. As of now, the Western, Southern, Northern, North Western and North Central provinces have been introduced to this facility.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

The funding aims to complete the essential components of the government\u2019s North Central Province Canal (NCPC) project, which transfers the excess water from the Mahaweli River to the country\u2019s dry northern and northwestern zones. This approval comes at a critical time for the island nation, following the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah in late November. The cyclone, which resulted in the country\u2019s worst flooding in two decades, damaged over 160,000 hectares of paddy fields and nearly 110,000 hectares of other crops, highlighting the urgent need for disaster-resilient irrigation systems. ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono noted that while Sri Lanka has made strides in reducing food insecurity, it remains a significant development challenge. Kadono emphasised that higher agricultural productivity and crop diversification are essential for long-term food security, necessitating adequate water resources and robust irrigation infrastructure. The ADB is leading a broad co-financing effort for the project. In addition to the bank\u2019s own US $ 200 million commitment, the initiative is expected to mobilise US $ 60 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development and US $ 42 million from the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The investment will finalise the construction of tunnels, open canals and covered canals connecting the Moragahakanda Reservoir to the reservoirs of Huruluwewa, Manankattiya, Eruwewa and Mahakanadarawa. Once completed, the infrastructure will irrigate approximately 14,912 hectares of paddy fields. The project also includes the implementation of a supervisory control and data acquisition system to streamline and modernise the NCPC operations. Beyond the basic infrastructure, the project targets the modernisation of farming practices through a commercial agriculture development component. This involves constructing 13 pressurised pipe distribution networks to provide \u201cwater on demand\u201d via drip irrigation to 5,039 hectares of upland fields. These upgrades are expected to directly benefit more than 35,600 farming households by enabling a shift toward high-value crops. The programme will encourage the farmers in the upland areas to cultivate perennial crops with export potential, such as mango, papaya, guava and passion fruit. In the lowland paddy areas, the project will support diversification into crops like mung bean, chili, maize and groundnut, particularly during the April to September Yala season. To ensure sustainability, the initiative will also assist the farmer organisations in operating as business entities, facilitating better access to financial services and fostering public-private partnerships.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

Early pilots in risk modelling, portfolio optimisation and payments security show that quantum capability is nearing its \u201cAI moment\u201d\u2014a stage where technological acceleration begins to outpace regulation, talent and security infrastructure. For financial institutions built on cryptography and digital trust, this transition presents both immense opportunity and profound systemic risk. Speakers emphasised that quantum adoption breaks with traditional technology cycles. A study by Boston Consulting Group was widely referenced, noting that up to 90 percent of quantum value will be captured by early adopters rather than fast followers. In this environment, waiting for standards to mature could mean losing the competitive edge entirely. Banks and capital markets players were urged to identify use cases now, build pilot programmes and prepare their systems for a quantum-safe future. A second challenge underscored throughout the festival was the rapidly widening talent gap. Quantum engineers, applied physicists and cryptographers are in critically short supply, and the pipeline is not growing fast enough to meet global demand. Several speakers compared the moment to the early internet era, but warned that the complexity and specialised expertise required for quantum technologies make early investment in education and research even more important. One of the clearest explanations of the coming risk came from Ray Harishankar, Vice President and Fellow at IBM. He urged the audience to frame the issue as \u201cquantum risk\u201d rather than \u201cquantum threat\u201d\u2014a capability shift with potential misuse if institutions are unprepared. The core vulnerability lies in the mathematical foundations of RSA and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), which protect most of the world\u2019s digital communication today. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor\u2019s algorithm\u2014a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)\u2014could break both almost instantly. Harishankar warned that adversaries are already acting. Encrypted data is being stolen today and stored for future decryption once quantum capability matures, a tactic known as \u201charvest now, decrypt later.\u201d To address this, he highlighted the urgency of adopting post-quantum cryptography (PQC), a class of quantum-resistant algorithms selected and standardised by NIST. Yet upgrading global cryptography\u2014used in more than 20 billion devices\u2014is unprecedented in scale. He argued that systems must now support \u201ccrypto-agility,\u201d enabling organisations to swap cryptographic components quickly and repeatedly as algorithms evolve. Professor Urbasi Sinha of the Raman Research Institute and University of Calgary added a complementary perspective through Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which secures communication using the laws of quantum physics rather than mathematical difficulty. Because quantum states collapse when observed, eavesdropping becomes immediately detectable. India has made notable progress with free-space QKD tests, moving-receiver demonstrations and readiness for satellite-based quantum communication. Long-term work on quantum repeaters could eventually support a global quantum-secure network. The convergence of quantum computing with artificial intelligence brought the sharpest warning. Cybersecurity expert Ralph Echemendia, known as \u201cThe Ethical Hacker,\u201d argued that AI already enables autonomous reconnaissance, exploit generation and real-time attack execution. When quantum capability amplifies these tools, he said, defence systems may be overwhelmed. He described this trajectory as \u201csynthetic evolution\u201d\u2014AI learning faster than humans, accelerated even further by quantum computation. He called the emerging competition a race for \u201cweapons of mass encryption,\u201d where control over quantum-secure and quantum-breaking capabilities may define digital power. The message from the festival was unequivocal: the quantum era has begun. Institutions must act now\u2014deploy PQC and QKD, build crypto-agile architectures, invest in scarce talent and integrate ethics and governance directly into system design. Decisions made today will determine the resilience of global finance in a quantum-enabled future.

As AI-generated content continues to surge globally, TikTok aims to remain a leader in responsible adoption by ensuring that creative advances are matched with clear labeling, robust safeguards, and meaningful user control. Accordingly, in the coming weeks TikTok will begin testing an AIGC control inside its existing \u2018Manage Topics\u2019 settings so people can choose how much AI-generated content they see. \u2018Manage Topics\u2019 already lets people tune the frequency of content by interest areas; the AIGC control works the same way. It serves as a personalization tool rather than a content-removal feature, enabling users to tailor their experience. Those who value AI-driven creative or educational material can surface more of it, while others may adjust their settings to see less. This choice supports discovery and user agency as the goal is to help people decide what kinds of content best match their expectations and values. TikTok is also strengthening how it labels AI-generated media. The platform already requires creators to disclose realistic AI content and combines creator disclosures, internal detection models, and industry metadata standards to do so. One such industry standard is C2PA Content Credentials, which embeds provenance metadata into a file so platforms and other tools that support C2PA can read whether, when and how content was created or edited. These systems have helped TikTok apply AIGC labels to over 1.3 billion videos to date. To add an extra layer of reliability, TikTok will begin applying an \u201cinvisible watermark\u201d to AI-generated content created with TikTok\u2019s tools and to content uploaded with C2PA credentials. This invisible watermark is a platform-readable signal embedded imperceptibly in the media; it is designed so that TikTok, using its own verification systems, can detect and read the watermark even when visible labels or metadata are stripped during reuploads or re-editing. Due to the watermark being embedded in ways that are not apparent to viewers, it is far harder for bad actors to remove or tamper with than a visible tag. The watermark therefore helps TikTok maintain consistent labeling and provides context about edits or transformations a piece of content has undergone, enabling more accurate enforcement and user information across reuploads. These measures build on TikTok\u2019s broader investments in trustworthy AI innovation, from creative tools that help people express themselves to AI systems that support safety and wellbeing across the platform. TikTok will continue to share updates as these programmes roll out and as the company works with industry partners to advance responsible practices for synthetic media.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

Launched in 2024, Union Assurance Suwamaga is a nationwide initiative aimed at addressing the alarming rise in diabetes prevalence across Sri Lanka. The programme is anchored on four strategic pillars: raising awareness about diabetes and its risks, promoting healthy lifestyles through education and engagement, supporting early detection and risk management, and fostering community participation. At the heart of the initiative is the Union Assurance Suwamaga Mobile Screening Unit, a fully equipped medical truck introduced in collaboration with the Diabetes Association of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Health. Staffed by certified healthcare professionals, the unit provides free diabetes screenings to the public, along with detailed health reports and personalised lifestyle modification advice to help reduce risk factors. In addition to the Mobile Screening Unit, Union Assurance partnered with its strategic partners and private healthcare providers to conduct screenings at selected locations nationwide, supplying essential equipment and resources to strengthen these outreach efforts. The Union Assurance Suwamaga Impact Report reviews the programme\u2019s achievements over a 15-month period from June 2024 to August 2025. During this time, the Company delivered free diabetes-related screenings to more than 23,000 lives, achieving island-wide coverage across all 25 districts and conducting screenings at 263 locations. The report provides valuable insights into diabetes related health concerns among the most affected segment of the population based on BMI, Random Blood Sugar/Fasting Blood Sugar, HbA1c testing, current health status and\u00a0 family health history derived from the total beneficiary sample. Commenting on the occasion, Chief Executive Officer of Union Assurance Senath Jayatilake stated, \u201cAt Union Assurance, every initiative we undertake reflects our commitment to empowering progress by protecting what matters,and a critical part of this focus is protecting the health of our people. In line with this brand vision, we are honoured to present the Union Assurance Suwamaga Impact Report, which demonstrates the reach and impact of our flagship CSR programme. While our initial goal was to reach 15,000 lives through direct screenings, we have successfully impacted over 23,000 individualsachieving 155% of our impact goal. This milestone is a testament to not only the scale of our outreach but also the depth of our impact, particularly at the grassrootslevel where access to healthcare is often limited.\u201d He further added, \u201cWe invite all stakeholders,especially policymakers and corporates,to reflect on these findings and take decisive steps toward collective action. This includes strengthening prevention strategies and driving greater awareness-building initiatives to combat diabetes at a national level. Together, we can create a healthier future for all Sri Lankans.\u201d Chief Marketing Officer of Union Assurance Mahen Gunarathna stated, \u201cOur data through the Union Assurance Suwamaga Impact Report tells a powerful story. Among the 13 percent of beneficiaries referred for further HbA1c testing, 76 percent were found to be in the diabetes stage. This alarming figure highlights the widespread nature of the disease and the urgent need for early intervention. Moreover, nearly 3 percent of beneficiaries were diagnosed with diabetes for the first time through Union Assurance Suwamaga, lives that may have otherwise gone undetected and untreated.\u201d \u201cBeyond diagnosis, the programme has sparked meaningful behavioural change, with 71 percent of beneficiaries reporting positive behavioural changes that led to improved health outcomes. This is a significant achievement, showing that Union Assurance Suwamaga is not just identifying issues, it\u2019sinspiring people to take action and transform their lives.As we look to the future, our commitment remains stronger than ever. We are excited to expand the reach of Union Assurance Suwamaga, deepen its impact, and continue advancing our vision of empowering the progress of all Sri Lankans,\u201d he added.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

Since its launch in November 2014, Project WAVE has reached over 5.8 million individuals, including employees of the John Keells Group, specific groups such as police officers, lawyers, university students, school children, teachers, parents, and the wider public. This year\u2019s campaign was rolled out under the theme \u201cUNiTE to Take Action Against Violence\u201d, adopting a multi-pronged approach that included internal awareness creation towards preventing and addressing gender based violence (through both awareness sessions as well as an all staff email campaign), a sustained social media campaign and community awareness programmes scheduled across business locations of the John Keells Group. All activities reinforce practical, proactive and everyday actions that individuals can take to prevent or address violence. A symbolic white ribbon pinning ceremony was also held with senior management and project staff, underscoring solidarity with survivors and commitment to ending violence. In addition, JKF\u2019s internal e-learning module as adapted for external audiences will soon be launched via the JKF\u2019s e-learning platform, with plans to extend access to universities and community groups. Krishan Balendra, Chairperson of the John Keells Group, in a message addressed to Group staff on the international day noted, \u201cWe operate on a zero-tolerance approach to any form of sexual harassment and remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for all employees. We also recognise that increasing female participation in the workplace is central to building a truly inclusive culture, and at John Keells Group this remains a key DE&I priority alongside our efforts to eliminate GBV. Our CSR initiatives have played a vital role in internalising these values within and outside the Group.\u201d Carmeline Jayasuriya, Head of CSR of the John Keells Group commented, \u201cOver the past 11 years since the launch of Project WAVE, much progress has been made in raising awareness, challenging misconceptions and biases, and strengthening ecosystems towards combatting GBV and child abuse. It has been a challenging course but we are encouraged by the progress made and remain committed to our mission of empowering a healthy and progressive Sri Lanka where all our citizens can work towards their aspirations and potential, unhindered by negative influences and social barriers\u201d. While the International Day serves as a focal point for global collective action, JKF\u2019s efforts extend well beyond this annual observance. Throughout the year, Project WAVE continues to collaborate with its partners and volunteers to deliver ongoing staff awareness and training, community awareness and empowerment, and specialised training of trainer programmes for law enforcement and other stakeholders, ensuring sustained impact across diverse groups in keeping with its vision `Empowering the Nation for Tomorrow\u2019.

REPA and other groups warned that this move could deter local investors and hinder the growth of the renewable energy sector. They emphasised the importance of energy supply for economic development and urged the Government to support sustainable energy initiatives. Darshana Liyanasekara, Chairman of REPA, highlighted the numerous benefits of renewable energy. He explained that generating and using sustainable energy aligns with global goals and fosters international cooperation. \u201cSolar power is highly feasible due to consistent sunlight and ample space for installation. It involves low investment and maintenance costs, minimal foreign exchange flow, and remains eco-friendly. The revenue stays within the country, boosting the local economy and creating jobs. Solar power supports the 2050 zero carbon energy goals, reduces production costs for local industries, and is crucial for meeting the 70 percent renewable energy target by 2030,\u201d he said. REPA Secretary Amal Sarathchandra addressed challenges in promoting solar energy. He noted that local investors are discouraged by unfair price revisions and delays in project approvals. \u201cTrust is further undermined by the suspension of new project contracts and inadequate support for existing installations,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial relief is hard to obtain, and the tax system imposes taxes on solar devices like panels and inverters.\u201d REPA Vice President Suresh Galanga emphasised the need to support local investors. He argued that while foreign investment offers temporary capital, it has long-term financial drawbacks, similar to foreign debt. \u201cMoney paid for electricity from foreign projects flows out of the country, much like diesel and coal expenditures,\u201d he said. \u201cEncouraging local investors through prioritised procurement guidelines and support is vital to revitalising the renewable energy sector.\u201d Chanaka Jayawardena, REPA\u2019s Treasurer said that boosting renewable energy generation, including solar power, would greatly benefit the country economically, given the high costs of fuel-based power generation. \u201cIn 2022 and 2023, Rs. 203.7 billion and Rs. 278.9 billion were spent on fuel-based power generation, respectively. This expenditure threatens the economy in both the short and long term. Installing 1,000 megawatts of solar power could add 1,320 gigawatt hours per year at a cost of Rs. 48.8 billion, while generating the same capacity with diesel would cost Rs. 92.4 billion.\u201d Electricity Consumers\u2019 Association President M.D.R. Athula and General Secretary Sanjeewa Dhammika also attended the briefing. They criticised the CEB\u2019s General Manager for directing officials to enter agreements under the revised tariff rates despite the Public Utilities Commission\u2019s directives not to implement it. 1 2 3 4 5 6  13 Dec 2025 5 hours ago 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 General : +94 0115 335 731 +94 0112 304 545 Circulation : +94 0112 479 611 Advertising : +94 0112 479 561 Subscription : +94 0112 479 626 Technical : +94 011 538 3437 helpdesk@wijeya.lk All the content on this website is copyright protected and can be reproduced only by giving the due courtesy to 'dailymirror.lk' Copyright \u00a9 2004 Wijeya Newspapers Ltd.", "content_hash": "b8c7d1d08d17e7d152f9974a533b3e7e", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:32:59.238793", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:32:59.238811", "update_count": 0}, "22": {"source": "DailyMirror", "section": "business", "title": "Windforce announces commissioning of 389 KWp off-grid solar power project in Zanzibar", "url": "https://www.dailymirror.lk/print/business-news/Windforce-announces-commissioning-of-389-KWp-off-grid-solar-power-project-in-Zanzibar/273-287916", "text": "Daily Mirror - Print Edition Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads Sun, 14 Dec 2025 Today's Paper 24 Jul 2024 - 487 Renewable energy company, Windforce PLC announced this week the successful commissioning of the 389 KWp Ground Mount Off-Grid Solar Power Project in\u00a0Zanzibar, Tanzania.

The decision, proposed by the Minister of Transport, Highways, and Urban Development, seeks to dispose of the property on a 99-year lease basis under an International Competitive Procurement Procedure. The property in question is a land plot approximately 02 roods and 23.1 perches in extent, owned by the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Situated at Perahera Mawatha, Colombo 03, the site is located in a commercially vital district near the Beira Lake and the central business district. The government had previously granted approval on September 13, 2024, to lease a portion of this land to a selected investor for a mixed development project. External records identify the investor selected during the September 2024 period as Global Leasing Limited, who had secured approval for a lease at Perahera Mawatha (Assessment No. 135). However, the Cabinet-appointed Standing Negotiations Committee recommended canceling the lease after the investor failed to fulfill the relevant assignment conditions. Consequently, the UDA Management Board granted approval on September 4, 2025, to recall proposals to find a suitable alternative development plan. As per the new investment conditions under the fresh terms approved by the Cabinet, the land will be released for hotel or commercial purposes. The government has placed strict zoning conditions on the new tender, stipulating that a maximum of 50 percent of the land can be utilised for residential purposes, ensuring the project aligns with the commercial demands of the area. The lease value will be determined based on the assessment of government\u2019s Chief Assessor.   222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

The Board of Directors resolved on December 9, 2025, to recommend the issue of up to 294,200,000 new ordinary voting shares at a price of Rs. 8.50 per share. The new shares will be offered to registered ordinary voting shareholders in the proportion of fourteen (14) new shares for every forty-five (45) shares held as of the record date. The subscription price of Rs. 8.50 represents a discount to the market price, with the bank\u2019s shares last trading at Rs. 9.50 as of September 30, 2025. If fully subscribed, the move will increase the bank\u2019s current stated capital of approximately Rs. 11.89 billion by a further Rs. 2.5 billion. According to the bank\u2019s corporate filing, the net proceeds from the issue are intended specifically to support lending activities. This capital infusion aligns with the aggressive growth strategy evident in the bank\u2019s recent performance; in its interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Cargills Bank reported a 31 percent expansion in its loan book, which grew by Rs. 14.3 billion to reach Rs. 60.4 billion. The bank\u2019s decision to raise capital follows a period of improved financial results. For the first nine months of 2025, Cargills Bank posted a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 313 million, marking a 97 percent increase compared to the Rs. 158 million reported in the corresponding period of the previous year. This profitability was supported by a 10 percent growth in net fee and commission income, which reached Rs. 682 million, and a significant 80 percent reduction in impairment charges, which fell to Rs. 162 million due to improved recovery actions and macro-economic conditions. Total assets also grew by 10 percent during the period to reach Rs. 88.5 billion. From a regulatory perspective, the capital raising also supports the bank\u2019s trajectory toward meeting higher capital requirements. While the bank currently maintains a Total Capital Ratio of 17.08 percent - well above the minimum requirement - it has been granted a timeline until the end of 2029 to comply with a regulatory minimum capital requirement of Rs. 20 billion. The proposed Rights Issue is subject to approval in principle from the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It also requires shareholder approval via a special resolution at an upcoming General Meeting.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

Commercial Bank Chairman Sharhan Muhseen attributed these record-breaking results to a disciplined focus on efficiency, digital innovation, and customer-centered transformation. He noted that these qualities enabled the Bank to strengthen its market position and make meaningful contributions to the national economic recovery. Reflecting on the recognition, Managing Director and CEO Sanath Manatunge stated that the ranking is a powerful endorsement of the discipline and purpose with which they steered the Bank through a year of tough conditions. He remarked that their performance was defined by navigating turbulence without losing sight of priorities such as strengthening fundamentals and supporting customers. Manatunge added that the ranking confirms their strategy is delivering results and that the Bank is firmly positioned to contribute to national progress with renewed confidence. Commenting on the wider landscape, Business Today noted that the 2024\u201325 Top 40 ranking celebrates the resilience and adaptability of Sri Lankan corporates in a gradually improving economic environment. The magazine observed that the past year marked a turning point driven by stabilization and policy realignment, with the winners exemplifying how restored economic stability is translating into stronger performance. Commercial Bank is the largest private sector lender in Sri Lanka and the country\u2019s first 100 percent carbon-neutral bank. It holds the highest Tier I capital base among local banks and was the first Sri Lankan bank to be listed among the Top 1000 Banks of the World and to exceed a market capitalisation of US$ 1 billion.   222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

The awards, organised by Mercer and CIPM Sri Lanka, serve as one of the country\u2019s most comprehensive benchmarking platforms for excellence in human resource management. The agency was selected from among 250 organisations across 16 sectors, a notable outcome given the limited representation of advertising agencies at such forums. The evaluation process covered 12 core areas, including HR strategy alignment, talent acquisition, learning and development, performance management, employee well-being and HR technology. Phoenix Ogilvy earned commendation for its ability to adapt these principles to the unique demands of the communications sector. Phoenix Ogilvy Group Head of Human Resources Sudeera Kelum said, \u201cThis recognition reflects our focus on building a workplace that supports creativity while ensuring employee well-being and professional development. In an industry known for its pace and pressure, we have worked to embed practices that balance performance with care for our people. Further, unlike creative awards that dominate the industry calendar, recognition for HR excellence is rare for agencies, making this achievement particularly significant for us.\u201d Among the factors that contributed to the win was the agency\u2019s mental health support framework, which includes in-house counselling by HR professionals with formal psychology qualifications, which is a decisive differentiator in an industry often associated with high stress. The judging panel also noted Phoenix Ogilvy\u2019s strong employee engagement initiatives, transparent leadership and a learning ecosystem aligned with global standards. The agency\u2019s HR function operates as a strategic partner, not a purely administrative role. It combines modern recruitment tools, digital maturity and performance-driven metrics with an inclusive culture that values diversity and creativity. This approach has positioned Phoenix Ogilvy as an example of how HR sophistication can thrive within creative industries, matching standards typically associated with larger corporates and government institutions. Phoenix Ogilvy\u2019s HR practices also reflect a commitment to employee well-being and inclusivity. The agency has introduced engagement initiatives that are participatory and creative, while maintaining strong legal and administrative discipline. Its recruitment strategy leverages the inherently diverse nature of advertising to build a workforce that represents varied perspectives and backgrounds. The recognition also underscores the agency\u2019s investment in learning and development, with programmes designed to cultivate next-generation talent and align with global creative industry standards. These initiatives ensure that the employees have access to continuous professional growth opportunities, reinforcing the agency\u2019s position as a future-ready workplace. This achievement adds to the Ogilvy Group Sri Lanka\u2019s broader success in 2025, which includes wins at Campaign Asia\u2019s Agency of the Year Awards, APAC Effies, ADFEST, Dragons of Sri Lanka and Effie Awards Sri Lanka, affirming the group\u2019s strength in both creative excellence and organisational culture.  222 Reply To: Name - Reply\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComment    Cyclone Ditwah Sri Lanka Live Updates \u2013 Death Toll, Floods, Landslides, International Aid and Government Alerts Understanding the flood aftermath: What Sri Lankans should be aware of now DHS detains Sri Lankan-born U.S. Professor, calls him \u2018sex offender\u2019 Sri Lanka to implement visa-free facility for 40 countries from January to aid post-Ditwah recovery BBC forecasts heavy showers in Sri Lanka over next few days A storm to hit Sri Lanka Sri Lankans have the highest IQ in South Asia War hero Gen.

The announcement made yesterday brings the much-needed financial support to industries and hotels. After having lobbied for lower electricity costs, the PUCSL\u2019s decision comes as a welcome change. Under the new tariff structure, hotels will be able to reap the benefit of a 26 percent reduction, while industries will see a 25.3 percent decrease. The overall reduction in electricity tariffs stands at 22.49 percent. The new rates are effective from today, July 16. The move is a notable shift from the series of tariff hikes imposed, which saw electricity costs soar by as much as 400 percent. The hike made it increasingly difficult for the industrial and tourism sectors to stay afloat. The tourism sector, which had managed to be categorised under the \u2018industry category\u2019 for electricity tariffs, after several episodes of tariff increases found itself paying exorbitant rates as it did when under the \u2018super-tariff\u2019 scheme. The private sector has been vocal about the overestimated tariff forecasts by the Ceylon Electricity Board, which led to unnecessarily high retail and industrial tariffs. However, their concerns did not receive much attention until now. Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel sector, a major contributor to the nation\u2019s export revenue, has repeatedly emphasised the need for a rigorous implementation of a least-cost generation plan. This, it argues, is essential for Sri Lanka to stay competitive, with the regions adopting low-cost generation and offering lower tariffs without subsidies. The sector also urged for power purchase agreements to be based on cutting-edge technology, with price discovery conducted through transparent competitive bidding. There is a strong call for policies that support the scaling up of renewable energy, including rooftop solar, in line with the government\u2019s goal of generating 70 percent of the country\u2019s energy from renewable sources by 2030. With increasing pressure from global brands for the decarbonisation of supply chains, Sri Lanka must move swiftly in adopting renewable energy solutions but at competitive prices, it said. 1 2 3 4 5 6  13 Dec 2025 5 hours ago 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 13 Dec 2025 General : +94 0115 335 731 +94 0112 304 545 Circulation : +94 0112 479 611 Advertising : +94 0112 479 561 Subscription : +94 0112 479 626 Technical : +94 011 538 3437 helpdesk@wijeya.lk All the content on this website is copyright protected and can be reproduced only by giving the due courtesy to 'dailymirror.lk' Copyright \u00a9 2004 Wijeya Newspapers Ltd.", "content_hash": "96f1d1dad44b7903c87185041ea8a38b", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:34:54.793852", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:34:54.793862", "update_count": 0}, "38": {"source": "DailyMirror", "section": "business", "title": "WindForce, Vidullanka ink share sale and purchase agreement with Hi-energy", "url": "https://www.dailymirror.lk/print/business/WindForce-Vidullanka-ink-share-sale-and-purchase-agreement-with-Hi-energy/215-287207", "text": "Daily Mirror - Print Edition Daily FT Sunday Times Mirror Edu Tamil Mirror Lankadeepa Middleast Lankadeepa Ada Deshaya Life Online Hi Online E-Paper Home delivery Advertise with us Mobile Apps feedback Archive Print Ads Sun, 14 Dec 2025 Today's Paper 15 Jul 2024 - 369 WindForce PLC and Vidullanka PLC have entered into a definitive share sale and purchase agreement with Hi-energy Services (Private) Limited last week, a filing to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) said.

While southern resorts have been largely unaffected by the crisis, the problem areas are the hill country and the Northcentral Province. All tourist sites have been closed since Thursday while some travellers are considering postponing their visit plans. Some resort properties in Nuwara Eliya had been damaged while the rooms of a hotel in Kandy had been flooded forcing about 35 guests to be shifted to the bar area. At the moment tourist arrivals are being postponed without any further notice since accessibility to hotels (particularly to the hill country) have been blocked as roads are flooded, Nuwara Eliya Hotels Association former President Shaam Weerasooriya has said. But these postponements will not be subjected to any charges. Meanwhile, travellers already in the country on tour or just arrived have been taken to safe hotels and transit hotels. Mr. Weerasooriya said some travellers have been placed in hotels somewhere closer to Colombo like the transit hotels as these places are functioning well especially the city hotels. Transportation is also provided to these locations in which areas the roads are accessible. Some tourists have also been placed in hotels in Kandy that are currently full due to their inability to go further to hotels like in Nuwara Eliya. Hotels in Nuwara Eliya have been in touch with travel agents and tour guides to establish communication with their guests and ensure their safety while touring or visiting the country, Mr. Weerasooriya said. He noted that the hotels are very safe and that the transportation systems are safe as well and a system to protect travelers when moving from one place to another. The Tourist Police has also been located in almost all police stations in areas where travelers are lodging to ensure their safety. Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators President Nalin Jayasundere said that they are ensuring the safety of all travellers and not taking any risks since certain roads are not passable. However, he noted there are no cancellations at present. Sri Lanka is reportedly facing the worst climatic conditions with incessant rains and strong winds resulting in 56 deaths, 14 injured and 21 displaced as at 9 am on Friday according to the Disaster Management Centre. This stormy weather named Ditwa has impacted 20 districts in the country. So far the main rivers have overflowed causing a flood situation in most areas and as a result of the heavy rains earth slips and landslides have been reported from a number of hilly areas due to which roads and railway lines have hampered travel to and from a number of districts. The crisis comes just as Sri Lanka is targeting 2.3-2.5 million tourists in 2025.

The move, approved by Cabinet in November 11, comes after the Central Bank flagged serious concerns about the long-term survival of both institutions. Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe did not mince words this week when he described the two specialised lenders as \u201cburdened with unsustainable business models, poor profitability and an inability to meet minimum capital requirements\u201d. Speaking at a media briefing, he said the regulator had drawn up a \u201ctargeted consolidation plan\u201d focusing on smaller banks to safeguard financial sector stability and protect depositors. According to the plan, the government\u2019s entire shareholding in HDFC incorporated under the Housing Development Finance Corporation Act of 1997 will be transferred to Bank of Ceylon (BOC), which will operate HDFC as its subsidiary.\u00a0 The State Mortgage and Investment Bank, established in 1975, will become a subsidiary of People\u2019s Bank (PB) under a similar transfer of state-owned shares. Dr. Weerasinghe highlighted that both HDFC and SMIB had \u201clow risk densities due to their heavy reliance on Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF)-backed loans\u201d, which carry zero risk-weighting but also reflect the narrowness of their loan books. Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings, in its latest review, supported this view, noting that the proposed transfers are unlikely to affect the ratings of BOC or PB. Several financial and banking analysts fear that once absorbed into larger banks, low-income housing borrowers traditionally served by these institutions could be de-prioritised in favour of more commercially attractive segments.

He noted that Australia is keen on supporting the Sri Lankan government\u2019s initiatives to boost productivity. Australia has been involved with Sri Lanka in ensuring the country is able to achieve the Blue Flag initiative and will support a marketing campaign for the country as well. Prof. Ranasinghe is said to have requested this support from Australia and as a result they will be providing the necessary advice based on the learnings of Australian tourism authorities. The marketing campaign will also be carried out with funding from Australia as well as expert knowledge that will engage with Sri Lankan partners. This campaign is expected to be carried out over a period of several years, Mr. Duckworth said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a warning to the public of a scam by this company noting that it is not licenced by the SEC and has no authority to trade in securities on behalf of investors. The company had lured their customers to deposit money in certain accounts, raising serious questions about the relevant banks\u2019 procedures in onboarding customers. The Sunday Times Business learned that the case has been handed over to the Central Bank along with the Criminal Investigations Department. Informed sources stated that authorities are also investigating information from the Immigration Department, as foreigners were allegedly involved in the scam. Additionally, the Computer Crimes Investigation Division is also looking into the matter. Analysts noted the incredulous nature of this scam, saying that the gullible nature of the average investor is still prevalent despite widespread information at their fingertips. \u201cThe first thing in stock trading involves opening a Central Depository Receipts or CDS account. One cannot trade with a simple bank account. And they (investors) should have verified before joining this scheme,\u201d one analyst said. The SEC has issued a clear warning regarding the dangers of unsolicited investment suggestions received through various online platforms such as SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook, and YouTube. Recent media advertisements from the SEC have highlighted the dangers posed by unqualified \u201cadvisors\u201d who take advantage of vulnerable individuals, enticing them into high-risk investments or fraudulent schemes. \u201cPromoters of such schemes repeatedly take advantage of individuals\u2019 financial desperation and their limited understanding of regulatory frameworks. They create a facade of legitimacy through their online presence, which can lure unsuspecting individuals into high-risk or fraudulent investment opportunities,\u201d a second analyst said.

A common issue is the lack of a complete record of personal data, including its storage locations and access permissions. There\u2019s also inconsistent data handling where different departments, such as Marketing, Sales, and Operations, follow their own processes for collecting, sharing, and retaining personal data, Rajeeva Bandaranaike, Chairman, Data Protection Authority (DPA) told The Sunday Times Business. This lack of standardisation makes it difficult to consolidate all personal information into one centralised location for the Data Protection Office, set to resume operations by early next year, to effectively manage and monitor compliance. Some organisations may lack clarity as to what qualifies as a \u201creportable\u201d incident under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) to DPA. There are limited awareness and training, with employees often lacking adequate understanding of PDPA obligations and privacy best practices, making it challenging to embed a strong privacy culture across the organisation, Mr. Bandaranaike said. \u201cTechnology gaps where legacy systems may not support access controls, encryption, or audit trails needed for compliance.\u201d In balancing compliance and business needs organisations face pressure to meet business objectives while ensuring PDPA compliance, he added. \u201cFor example, a company may be restricted from using its existing customer database for marketing communications, as the PDPA requires explicit consent. This can render previously collected data unusable and impact marketing effectiveness.\u201d Continuous monitoring is not easy, he said as it-it\u2019s hard to maintain ongoing compliance; most organisations focus only during audits or certifications. Lack of top-management ownership-privacy is seen as an IT or legal issue, not a strategic business responsibility, he pointed out. \u201cThere are resource constraints, especially for small and medium entities that lack dedicated privacy teams or budgets.\u201d Send Email to Friend Hitad.lk has you covered with quality used or brand new cars for sale that are   budget friendly yet reliable!

Officials at the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) told The Sunday Times Business that they were able to control the spread of the disease by taking the right measures and cutting down the affected trees. It was noted that there was no medication or chemical that could be used to eradicate this disease that had affected some coconut trees in the Galle, Weligama and parts of Hambantota district. The only solution for the eradication of the disease was to cut down the tress and then destroy them where the insects are found. Officials note that no medical solution had been found anywhere else in the world either. It was pointed out that once these affected trees were cut down no new plants were allowed to be replanted for about the last seven years since the threat of the spread of the disease was high. During this time the CRI has ensured that the rest of the coconut plants are monitored by maintaining a radius of 3km where the disease is less prevalent. Within and outside this 3km border, areas are being monitored and as a result some areas have now been released for new replanting with a disease resistant variety. The resistant variety is produced by making a Green Dwarf coconut plant cross with a tall variety that is called CRIC 365. For the first time last year replanting commenced by the CRI. Another preventive measure adopted by the authorities was to not send the coconut plucked out of these areas outside of the region they were cultivated in a bid to control the spread of the disease to other parts of the country. Of the approximately 65 million coconut trees in the country only about 300,000 have been affected and cut down. Due to the constant monitoring carried out by the CRI the authorities in Sri Lanka have been able to control the spread of the disease to any other areas. The disease is still prevalent in these parts of the country and it continues to be monitored by the CRI.

This model encourages continuous innovation through competition, accelerates service quality improvements, and eliminates the government\u2019s need for large upfront investment, Hasith Yaggahavita, CEO of 99X, said. This will fast-track the development of digital public infrastructure and significantly strengthen the country\u2019s digital economy, Mr. Yaggahavita, CEO of 99x, told the Sunday Times Business. He said that governments are increasingly looking at innovative methods to increase the delivery of public services, and a promising approach will be developing APIs for citizen services, which allows private companies, including start-ups and university students, to create applications that utilise these API\u2019s. This will decrease public expenditure and also boost ongoing innovation and cultivate a competitive digital ecosystem, he added. He also noted that many countries, such as India, the UK, and Rhonda, have implemented such methods. \u201cA technical model can be created here where the government exposes secure API related to identity, taxes, fines, land records, postal services and utilities,\u201d he added. He said that subsequently, developers can access these applications and interact with these API, enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of public services. While encouraging the partnership between public and private sectors, this will streamline service delivery, he added.

He said that this rich tapestry of food would be an occasion to celebrate diversity. The suggestion came just as the government announced the Sri Lanka Day event to be held in December as a means of bridging the ethnic divide and celebrating Sri Lanka\u2019s multicultural societies. He is still waiting for a reply! That person was our young economist Ruwanputha . He called me on this Thursday morning to discuss the same topic, after reading about JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva, during a visit to London, inviting Sri Lankans to come home for the three-day festival from December 14 to 16 and celebrate the event\u2019s unity theme. \u201cI wrote to Sri Lanka Tourism many months ago to organise a food fiesta featuring the food of many communities for tourists and Sri Lankans, but sadly they didn\u2019t respond. Not even an acknowledgement of the email. This is the kind of public service that we have today. Here is an idea that they should take forward, as food is a great way to bring communities together, but sadly they didn\u2019t respond,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the problem in Sri Lanka\u2026..there is limited space in the public service for creativity and innovation. No one listens if you have a good idea. That happens only in the private sector,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe if I had proposed the idea to tourism industry associations it may have been taken on board,\u201d he said. Ruwanputha\u2019s suggestion was a simple one. December is the period when the country is filled with tourists (coming during the winter season) and also Sri Lankans resident abroad returning home for their annual year-end vacation and it is good to celebrate Sri Lanka Day with a food festival. The National Peace Council (NPC) in a statement said that the government was promoting Sri Lankan Day as a national platform to bring every community together. While the vision behind this event would be to create a space where all citizens can feel included and respected regardless of political, religious or cultural identity, it pointed out that it is \u201cimportant that opposition parties and civil society organisations are also included, so that the event reflects the full diversity of the country\u201d. While peace and reconciliation are considered the barometer of success of a society, one of the most forgotten aspects of culture and diversity is the colourful range of food of the different communities. Real peace and reconciliation has eluded Sri Lanka, despite efforts by many governments. One very easy aspect of bridging the ethnic divide is food and music. The diversity of food cuts across many cultural barriers. In fact in recent times, many tourists keen on learning the country\u2019s culture have visited villages and watched how food is prepared. In one step further in this process, they have also joined in the cooking, pounding ingredients in a stone mortar, preparing string hoppers and hoppers and other everyday food. Consider the rich variety of Sri Lankan food coming down the ages and influenced by our colonial masters. From the Sinhalese, you have Ambul Thiyal, a sour fish curry, Kaju Maluwa, a cashew curry, Kottu, a battered mixture of meat, vegetables and rotti made to the exciting sounds of the baila, Kiribath and Pol Sambola. From the Tamils come Appam and Indiappam (hoppers and string hoppers) from South India, Murukku, Pittu and Kiri Toffee, though some may argue that the latter is a food developed by the Sinhalese. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the food and its exquisite taste that matters, not from where it originated. The Malay community is famous for Dodol, Satay (fried beef) and Achcharu which comes from the Malay word Achar known as Malay pickle, while the Burghers celebrate their rich past with Lamprais, Rich Cake and Breudher. The small Borah community contribution is through Bombay sweets which includes Muskat. Then consider the variety of music and dances with baila, a Portuguese-origin musical song and dance form, taking pride of place. In fact, when the baila is played at family and public functions, guests let their hair down and join in the singing and dancing\u2026\u2026.communities get together and it\u2019s like time spent in the kindergarten where it didn\u2019t matter if your fellow student came from a different community. There was no class distinction or barriers on racial lines. Everyone was alike and teachers made sure everyone was treated equally. Food and music are great ways to overcome divisions and hostility among races and bring better results than speeches and special events heralding Sri Lanka\u2019s diversity. Consider a band like the Gypsies and its late, legendary leader Sunil Perera. He would have been the ideal ambassador of peace. His iconic song \u2018Piti Kotapan None\u2019 is a staple offering at many functions and weddings. Music and food indeed bring the world together and what better place than Sri Lanka where you enjoy a shot of arrack among friends with a variety of side dishes as bites. After becoming tipsy, enmity and bitterness are forgotten \u2013 we all become machans! Hotels sometimes organise festivals of food of other countries \u2013 why not the food of Sri Lanka\u2019s cultural tapestry! The government has chosen an ideal time \u2013 December, to celebrate Sri Lanka\u2019s diversity. As stated before, this is the month when tourists come in droves and Sri Lanka expatriates in the West migrate to their more pleasant (weather-wise) homeland.

The new facility will serve as a centralised inspection point for all local import and export containers handled through Hambantota International Port (HIP), strengthening the port\u2019s role as a key logistics gateway for southern Sri Lanka. The Rs. 1 billion project represents a significant private-sector commitment to enhance operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and trade facilitation. The developer will integrate modern technology and infrastructure in close collaboration with Sri Lanka Customs and other relevant government agencies involved in container inspection. The groundbreaking ceremony launching the partnership was also attended by senior Sri Lanka Customs officials, including the Director General of Customs Seevali Arukgoda, the port said in a media release. \u201cThis facility is mainly targeted at servicing the southern hinterland of Sri Lanka. With the Colombo Port facing an excess of supply, HIP can help reduce the pressure by providing an efficient alternative for container handling and inspection,\u201d said Ravi Wijeratne, Chairman of RCT. \u201cThese extensions to the container yard are in line with our original master plan for Hambantota,\u201d says Wilson Qu, CEO of HIPG. \u201cEach new development strengthens the port\u2019s ability to meet the growing logistical demands of the region and positions HIP as a key enabler of trade and industrial growth in southern Sri Lanka.\u201d Founded in 1994, Rank Container Terminals operates Sri Lanka\u2019s leading Inland Clearance depot facility in Colombo, and is recognised as the country\u2019s pioneer import inspection facility. RCT is also the largest terminal operator in Sri Lanka to host all key government and regulatory agencies in-house, including Sri Lanka Customs, and other government authorities.

While these plans are still at a nascent stage, expansion outside the country is definitely on the cards in the next five to 10 years, officials said, responding to a question by The Sunday Times Business at a media event hosted by the company recently. They said that the company is quite optimistic about the current market and is geared to cater to all the segments while being bullish on opening branches and expanding island-wide. Laksanda Gunawardena, CEO of MI Finance, stated that the company has opened 43 branches over the past 18 months. \u201cBy the end of this financial year, we hope to bring our branch network to 91,\u201d he said. The plan is to move out of Colombo to more rural areas, he added. He said that the opening up of the vehicle market has boosted the company\u2019s financial position. \u201cThe loan book growth and the growth in the asset base of the company have helped its financials,\u201d he added. MI Finance reported a 34 per cent rise in profit before tax to 837 million. Its lending portfolio increased from Rs. 37 billion to Rs. 75 billion, with loans comprising 35 per cent of this portfolio. Gold pawning was at 16 per cent of the loan portfolio at Rs. 12 billion as of 31st March. In an industry average of 8 per cent non-performing loan ratio, the company is maintaining a 2.8 per cent net average. Net interest income rose 24 per cent to Rs 3.4 billion, propelled by a 27 per cent increase in core book revenue and strategic repricing that lowered funding costs. The profitability surge was achieved alongside robust 40 per cent annualised growth in deposits, mobilised through the company\u2019s expanded network of 85 branches, Mr. Gunawardana added. He also noted that MI Finance is extremely positive about the Secure Transaction Registry recently launched by the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB). The company is in discussion with CRIB to onboard this platform, he added.

This year\u2019s celebrations are especially significant as they coincide with FAO\u2019s 80th anniversary, eight decades dedicated to support sustainable fisheries, food security, and coastal livelihoods worldwide. The event was organised by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Bay of Bengal Programme Inter-Governmental Organization (BOBP-IGO), in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka. The celebration brought together representatives from Bangladesh, India, Maldives, and Sri Lanka, along with fisher organisations, partners, and local institutions, to strengthen regional cooperation in the fisheries sector, the FAO said in a media release. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya speaking at the event \u201cSri Lanka is proud to host this event,\u201d said Sri Lankan Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya. \u201cMore than 4.3 million Sri Lankans depend directly or indirectly on fisheries for their livelihoods, and our ocean, rivers and lakes. By working together with our partners, we are advancing shared goals for sustainability, resilience and prosperity, ensuring that our coastal communities can thrive for generations to come\u201d. Observed globally on November 21, World Fisheries Day recognises the importance of sustainable fisheries for food security, livelihoods and economic growth. It calls attention to the need for responsible management of aquatic resources, better working conditions for fishers, and greater recognition of their role in local and global aquatic food systems. This year, FAO and BOBP-IGO marked the day by showcasing how regional cooperation and local commitment are shaping a stronger, more sustainable small-scale fisheries sector across the Bay of Bengal.

While Capital Metals PLC positions the project as a world-class resource development with transformative economic potential, newly detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) findings reveal a more complex, high-stakes picture along the island\u2019s fragile eastern coastline. The project\u2019s potential and favourable economics were highlighted at a recent promotional event hosted by the Sri Lankan High Commission in London. Officials emphasised improving macroeconomic indicators, policy reforms and an upcoming Investment Protection Act aimed at strengthening investor confidence. Capital Metals\u2019 phased development strategy keeps upfront capital low. An initial US$25 million investment is expected to generate $35-40 million in annual revenue at sub-$20 million operating costs. The total project requires $80 million, and despite higher taxes and royalties introduced in Sri Lanka, updated modelling shows a strong Net Present Value of $180 million. Local partnerships are central to navigating regulatory complexities. Ambeon Capital\u2019s $4 million investment for a 20 per cent stake has strengthened the company\u2019s domestic presence. The firm currently holds the only mineral-sands mining licence in the country and awaits two further approvals-licence expansion and export clearance. With first production targeted for early 2027, Capital Metals argues that the Taprobane project represents a rare opportunity: a high-grade, low-cost, strategically located mineral asset trading at a market value well below its economic potential. The project is located on the Akkaraipattu-Komari coastal belt in the Ampara District, Eastern Province, close to the towns of Pottuvil and Akkaraipattu. This 50-300 metre-wide stretch of beach known for its rich deposits of ilmenite, rutile, zircon, garnet and sillimanite has been divided into five sections: Tampaddai, Thirukkovil, Mulliadi, Omari and Sangamankanda. The total recoverable heavy mineral content is estimated at 5.43 million tonnes, making it one of the highest-grade undeveloped deposits globally. However, the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for the proposed mining operation offers a measured warning while granting overall clearance and concluding that the project\u2019s economic benefits outweigh environmental costs. The assessment identifies significant ecological risks. Two rare plant species, five endemic species and 12 nationally threatened plants have been recorded on the sand dunes set to undergo mining. The report states that disturbing such habitats will have \u201cmajor impacts on the ecology and biodiversity of the area\u201d. Although lagoons and mangroves fall outside the direct mining zone, the EIA warns of indirect disturbances to wildlife due to dust, noise and vibration. Strict mitigatory measures, continuous monitoring and early-warning systems have been recommended to prevent long-term ecological harm.

The bank\u2019s Development Credit Department, together with its Kaduruwela Branch, recently hosted the inaugural awareness programme titled \u201cEnhancing Paddy Productivity and Farmer Livelihoods through Adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and High-Tech Agriculture in the Polonnaruwa District\u201d, the bank said in a media release Held at the Agbo Hotel, Giritale, the event brought together more than 120 farmers from eight divisional areas, representing the district\u2019s diverse agricultural communities. This initiative is part of Commercial Bank\u2019s broader vision to drive national food security, empower the rural economy, and support farmers through knowledge-sharing and sustainable agricultural solutions that foster long-term economic resilience. While Polonnaruwa\u2019s average yield currently stands at around 4.5 metric tonnes per hectare, agricultural experts estimate the potential yield at approximately six metric tonnes. To help bridge this gap, the programme focused on creating awareness about modern cultivation methods, responsible use of agro-chemicals, mechanisation, financial management, and environmental sustainability. The bank said the initiative aims to position Polonnaruwa as a model district for sustainable, GAP-based paddy cultivation. It also seeks to promote financial inclusion among rural communities by connecting farmers with formal banking channels and customised financial solutions to fund mechanisation, crop diversification, and value-added processing.

This move will bring a large number of small retailers into the tax net and ultimately pass the 18 per cent VAT burden onto consumers. It will also create an imbalance in the economy, as most consumers will shift their purchases toward goods and services provided by businesses that are not liable for VAT. At a time when people are already struggling with the rising cost of living, this will be yet another blow to both small enterprises and the wider population,\u201d asserted Mahendra Perera, President of the Ceylon Federation of MSME, adding that many shops and small businesses will be trapped in this financial dilemma. Speakers at the event: Mr. Mahendra Perera (left) and Mr. G. K. Sudath Kumar. Pic by M.A.Pushpa Kumara. He was speaking at the Sunday Times Business Club (STBC)\u2019s bi-monthly meeting on Tuesday which focused on the \u2018collapse of small Sri Lankan businesses\u2019 owing to the Easter Sunday attack, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. The host hotel of the meeting is Shangri-La and the sponsor of the club is NDB Bank. He said like in many other countries, the MSME sector is the backbone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. MSMEs contribute 52 per cent to the national GDP and provide employment to 4.5 million people in the workforce. Quoting 2022 data from the Department of Census and Statistics, he said out of 1.3 million MSMEs, 263,000 have permanently closed, 14,577 are temporarily closed, and approximately 1,050,000 remain active. This data represents the situation up to 2022; however, the major impacts of the economic crisis was felt most strongly in 2023\u20132024. \u201cTherefore, we believe that an additional 100,000 or more enterprises have already been affected due to the bankruptcy declaration and the sharp rise in interest rates,\u201d he added. Mr. Perera said while parate execution was temporarily suspended, the extension ended in March 2025 and now a large number of MSME assets are already in the process of being auctioned. The Parate Act, which dates back to 1990, urgently needs to be amended to reflect current economic realities. Although the present government issued two circulars in December 2024 and January 2025, these have failed to address the core issues faced by MSMEs, pointing out that even though Rs. 50 billion was allocated for the MSME sector in the 2026 Budget, more than 60 per cent of MSMEs are listed in CRIB with Non-Performing Loan (NPL) status, making access to capital finance extremely difficult. The second speaker at the event, liquidator expert G. K. Sudath Kumar, Partner \u2013 Nanayakkara & Company, detailed out the various options offered to bankrupt firms via the process of an administrator or, if that doesn\u2019t work, liquidation. He said many companies are going into liquidation, and faced with the growing number of cases, one of the commercial high courts has been set aside purely for liquidation cases. When a company is unable to pay its debt, the directors of the company seek court permission to either wind up the company or declare bankruptcy. An administrator is then appointed, as a first step, to see whether the company can be revived after speaking to all creditors and debtors on restructuring due payments and restructuring the debt. In some cases, resuscitation succeeds, in some cases it won\u2019t. It\u2019s a fine balancing act by the administrator, he pointed out adding that in the Sri Lanka case, many people don\u2019t trust an administrator and this is an issue.

With seven out of 10 Sri Lankans banking with People\u2019s Bank and one out of every five retail and business loans in the country originating from the bank, this exceptional performance reinforces its position as the most trusted and influential financial services provider in Sri Lanka, it said. Operating income stood at Rs. 121.9 billion, a substantial 99.4 per cent increase, supported by exceptional core earnings. Net interest income nearly doubled to Rs. 103.9 billion, driven by effective asset\u2013liability repricing amid changing market conditions, resulting in an improvement of the bank\u2019s net interest margin to 4 per cent, compared to 3.4 per cent in December 2024. The bank also recorded its highest-ever net fees and commissions for the period, reaching Rs. 12.2 billion, reflecting strong customer activity and strengthened transactional volumes. While the bank\u2019s solo results formed the foundation of its record performance, the group\u2019s consolidated results also remained strong. Consolidated post-tax profit reached Rs. 30.5 billion, with operating income amounting to Rs. 139.5 billion, an 85 per cent growth over the previous year.

What began as government policy rooted in environmental concerns has now created a widening economic gap one that industry stakeholders warn could take years to repair without urgent government intervention, industry stakeholders said Since the CPO import ban came into effect in April 2021, Sri Lanka has spent over US$175 million importing edible oils to meet domestic demand-an expense the country can ill afford amid its ongoing balance-of-payments pressures. Although a functioning oil-palm industry once supplied part of the almost-264,000 metric tonnes consumed annually domestically, the nation continues to depend nearly wholly on imports The fallout has been especially severe for Board of Investment (BOI) enterprises that relied on CPO as a key raw material for exports. These manufacturers once regular suppliers of hydrogenated palm-oil products such as vanaspathi ghee, bakery shortening, CBS fats and chocolate fats have collectively incurred losses estimated at $40 million. Their export pipelines collapsed after access to CPO was cut off in 2022, despite preferential market access under the Indo\u2013Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA). Ironically, India Sri Lanka\u2019s largest trading partner has recently reopened the same HS codes for palm-oil-based imports, while simultaneously increasing its own edible-oil tariffs. The result is a surge in demand for Sri Lankan processed palm-oil exports, but domestic producers remain paralysed without access to CPO. Industry representatives, in a detailed submission to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, have called for an immediate policy reset. They seek approval for BOI-registered companies to import CPO (HS Code 1511.10) through a tightly regulated licensing mechanism. Such a step, they argue, would restore export production, support domestic edible-oil supply chains, and generate an estimated $75 million annually in new export revenue. The appeal goes beyond short-term import relief. Plantation companies are also urging the government to lift the nationwide prohibition on new oil-palm cultivation a ban introduced in 2022 that abruptly halted a sector specifically developed to reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s edible-oil deficit. They propose a structured replanting programme of 10,000 acres annually, projecting that the country could achieve edible-oil self-sufficiency and even generate an export surplus within six years. Their argument is rooted in regional trends. India, which imports nearly eight million tonnes of palm oil annually, has already launched a massive programme to cultivate oil palm on five million hectares-a signal that palm cultivation, when regulated, is strategically valuable for food security. As Sri Lanka prepares for its 2026 shift from the Special Commodity Levy to a more predictable ad valorem tax structure for imported oils, one question lingers on: will policy reform come soon enough? The answer might mean life or death for manufacturers, plantation workers, and rural communities whose livelihoods depend on the sector.

To relegate AI to next year\u2019s agenda is to overlook its profound capacity to reshape operational paradigms, accelerate innovation, and redefine competitive advantage. Organisations can start with enterprise AI gradually, focusing on incremental use cases that drive efficiency and innovation without requiring major budgets or disruptive system changes. Yet, this promise is interwoven with nuances and intricacies that boards must navigate with discernment. The mandate is not to stifle adoption but to enable it responsibly, embedding AI within a governance architecture that harmonises ambition with accountability. AI is revolutionising how leaders and teams manage complexity, but its power must be guided responsibly. Board members can receive concise summaries of lengthy board papers before meetings, saving hours of preparation, while CEOs leverage AI to draft strategic briefs or scenario analyses in minutes. CFOs gain rapid financial insights, company secretaries can turn meeting transcripts into accurate minutes, and auditors accelerate risk reviews with AI-assisted checks. Sales teams prioritise leads, and call centre managers analyse customer sentiment instantly. These capabilities are real and accessible today, but they demand human-in-the-loop oversight, especially as organisations experiment with automated decision-making in areas like credit approvals, recruitment screening, and compliance alerts. Boards must ensure these systems remain transparent, explainable, and subject to human override to prevent bias, errors, and regulatory breaches. Achieving this balance calls for a truly cross-functional approach, aligned with the organisation\u2019s defined and regularly revisited risk appetite and tolerance levels. Boards set the strategic vision and provide oversight, while ICT and data teams build secure, scalable systems. Compliance and legal functions ensure regulations and contracts are met, risk managers anticipate and mitigate emerging threats within acceptable boundaries, and both internal and external audit update their programmes to include algorithm audits, data governance checks, bias and fairness testing, explainability reviews, cybersecurity controls, and assurance that human-in-the-loop oversight is maintained. Agile practices must also be embedded to adapt quickly to regulatory changes and emerging risks. Together, these roles create a unified governance framework that turns AI into a responsibly managed strategic asset driving innovation while staying within agreed risk parameters. AI exists across a spectrum of capability. At the foundational level is \u2018Narrow AI\u2019, systems built for a single purpose, such as Siri or Alexa handling voice commands, Netflix\u2019s recommendation engine tailoring content, or spam filters protecting email inboxes. A step further is \u2018Advanced Narrow AI\u2019, which remains domain-specific but demonstrates remarkable sophistication. Examples include ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Perplexity AI, China\u2019s ERNIE Bot, and DeepSeek. These systems can generate text, summarize documents, translate languages, assist with coding; enable computer vision for autonomous vehicles; and power scientific tools like AlphaFold for protein structure prediction. Beyond these practical applications lies \u2018General AI (AGI)\u2019, still hypothetical, which would mirror human cognitive flexibility, an AI capable of designing buildings, managing finances, and learning new skills without retraining. Some multi-modal AI systems (combining text, image, audio, and video) and agent-based architectures are moving toward AGI-like behaviour, but they remain domain-constrained. The ultimate frontier is \u2018Super AI\u2019 (ASI, with even post-ASI possibilities), a theoretical stage where machines surpass human intelligence entirely, a theoretical stage where machines surpass human intelligence entirely, innovating and governing at scales beyond human comprehension. While AGI and ASI remain aspirational, Narrow and Advanced Narrow AI are already transforming corporate operations, regulatory compliance, and government service delivery, bringing both unprecedented opportunities and governance challenges that demand immediate board-level attention. The EU AI Act, along with emerging national laws, OECD principles, and country-level AI strategies, is shaping a global regulatory landscape for responsible AI adoption. Together, these frameworks create a compliance environment that demands proactive data governance, AI inventorying, risk classification, vendor oversight, explainability, and robust accountability processes well before fully automated systems are deployed.

He emphasised that alerts issued on 12 and 18 November had not materialised into a cyclone and only pointed to the possibility of a low-pressure system or depression. The Minister maintained that those earlier warnings could not have warranted the same level of emergency response that was activated after the confirmed warning on 25 November. Responding to questions raised by The Sunday Morning , Wijepala said: \u201cI do not see any necessity for appointing a separate parliamentary committee to examine disaster management structures, because this demand is politically motivated and comes at a time when the entire country recognises that we have faced floods and landslides on an unprecedented scale.\u201d \u201cWhile I cannot predict what the Government\u2019s final position will be, my personal view is that an additional oversight body will not meaningfully improve the response to such disasters,\u201d he added. Defending the Government against allegations of negligence, he said: \u201cWhat we experienced was a natural disaster of a magnitude rarely seen in Sri Lanka. It is important to note that the alerts on 12 and 18 November ultimately did not develop into a cyclone, whereas the warning issued at 10 a.m. on 25 November proved accurate. It immediately prompted the activation of all relevant disaster response mechanisms in line with established procedures.\u201d Wijepala further said that once the 25 November warning had been received, the Government had moved swiftly and strictly in conformity with protocol. He noted that the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), Irrigation Department, Police, armed forces, and other relevant agencies coordinated closely to disseminate warnings and prepare for emergency response. \u201cPublic announcements urging evacuation were issued at least three times. Mobile phone alerts were sent to residents in high-risk areas when rainfall exceeded critical thresholds, and Police officers were deployed on the ground to directly notify communities. The landslides began on the night of 26 November,\u201d he pointed out. Referring to the impact on communities, the Minister said: \u201cFrom what I personally observed in Nikaweratiya in the Kurunegala District, the scale of rainfall and destruction was unlike anything we have experienced in recent memory, and official data clearly shows that around 95% of the recorded fatalities were caused by landslides, with comparatively fewer deaths resulting from floods or falling trees, which indicates that greater compliance with evacuation advice in identified high-risk areas could have significantly reduced the loss of life.\u201d He further noted that the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) had reported landslides occurring in locations not previously identified on hazard maps, underscoring the evolving and unpredictable nature of the disaster. Wijepala said this had exposed fundamental limitations in Sri Lanka\u2019s disaster preparedness framework, which remained largely reactive in design, and pointed out that the early warning systems currently in use were mostly acquired after the 2004 tsunami and were now in urgent need of technological upgrading. Emphasising the limits of forecasting, he said that an early warning, by its very nature, signalled that a disaster may occur and not that it would occur with certainty. \u201cWhen hundreds of lives are lost within a short period, it painfully underscores the limits of forecasting and response mechanisms, especially when some residents refuse to evacuate despite repeated advisories and clear risks to their lives,\u201d he added. Turning to political criticism, Wijepala charged that the Opposition was attempting to capitalise on this disaster for political advantage, because when the Government carried out its responsibilities properly, the Opposition struggled to find substantive grounds for criticism. \u201cThey instead exploit natural calamities to remain relevant, whether through calls for select committees or threats of negligence-related legal action. The President has openly challenged them to pursue legal action if they genuinely believe there is a basis for such claims. Let them try,\u201d he challenged. Acknowledging imperfections, the Minister said: \u201cNo system or strategy is perfect and we are ordinary individuals working within the constraints of available information and resources. While forecasts predicted rainfall of between 100 and 200 millimetres, some areas recorded more than 400 millimetres. With better predictive data certain decisions might have been taken differently, but based on the information available at the time the Government did the best it could in accordance with established procedures.\u201d   The Morning is Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost national news brand, delivering timely insights across politics, current affairs, sport, and entertainment.

Wootler confirmed yesterday (13). He said disciplinary action would be taken against the officer concerned for failing to perform his duties properly. The accident occurred late on the night of Thursday (11) in the Denimulla area of Sapugaskanda in the Gampaha District, when the jeep in which Ranwala was travelling collided head-on with a car. Police said three occupants of the car \u2013 a 25-year-old woman, her six-month-old infant, and her 55-year-old mother \u2013 had sustained injuries and had been admitted to the hospital. The infant had later been transferred to the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children for specialised treatment. Ranwala had also sustained injuries in the collision and had been admitted to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL), Colombo. While he was undergoing treatment, officers from the Sapugaskanda Police had visited the hospital as part of the investigation. Explaining the sequence of events, ASP Wootler said: \u201cOfficers from the Sapugaskanda Police proceeded to the NHSL, where they observed that the individual was under medical treatment. They did not conduct a sobriety test at that time but instead requested a medical report from the attending doctor.\u201d He added that the report had not been received yet. The Police Spokesperson further acknowledged that no arrangements had been made at the scene of the accident to administer a breathalyser test or to produce the suspect before a JMO. Ranwala was formally arrested on Friday (12), while he was receiving treatment at the NHSL. The Police said that he had been taken into custody on charges of dangerous driving and failing to prevent an accident. He was later produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate\u2019s Court and released on cash bail of Rs. 200,000. Although he remains hospitalised, the Police confirmed that he was no longer in custody. Addressing public criticism over the absence of an immediate breathalyser test, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala said established procedures had been followed and rejected allegations of preferential treatment. He said the protocol required the Police to conduct a breathalyser test when making an arrest, or, if the suspect had been hospitalised, to obtain a medical assessment from the hospital. \u201cThe procedure is that if the Police is making an arrest, they will have to do the breathalyser test, or if he is admitted to the hospital, then the hospital must ascertain whether he is drunk or not,\u201d Wijepala said. He noted that Ranwala had been taken directly to the hospital rather than to a Police station, and that a medical report had therefore been requested. \u201cOnce the report is presented, we will determine the next steps,\u201d he said. Wijepala insisted that Ranwala had been treated in the same manner as any other citizen and that no double standards had been applied. \u201cJust like any other ordinary person, all steps have been taken properly. We are not playing hide-and-seek like previous governments. He has been treated as an ordinary citizen. No double standards. The law is equal to everyone,\u201d the Minister said. He added that the arrest and court process demonstrated that the incident had not been handled as an exception. \u201cHe was arrested, produced before the courts, and bail was granted,\u201d Wijepala said, while also cautioning against politicising road accidents. \u201cThis is not an exceptional incident where he has acted in a manner unbecoming of a politician. Politicians are human beings too, and accidents happen on the road. Sometimes it is unavoidable, and the law treats everyone equally.\u201d ASP Wootler said investigations into the accident itself were ongoing, including assessments of vehicle movements and other contributing factors. Further developments are expected once the medical report is received and the internal inquiry into the Police lapse is concluded.

The audit revealed that of the 25,649 sq km selected for detailed mapping at a scale of 1:10,000, only 10,560 sq km had been surveyed as of the audit date. This leaves 15,089 sq km \u2013 potentially home to thousands of vulnerable structures \u2013 unassessed. The findings come against the backdrop of Cyclone Ditwah, which caused widespread destruction in the country\u2019s Central Province. Following the disaster, the NBRO faced severe criticism over the effectiveness of its landslide warnings, with residents claiming they were left confused about whether to evacuate or remain in their homes, as the alerts had failed to specify the exact high-risk locations. However, in response to the audit report, the NBRO stated that the preparation of landslide hazard zone maps at a 1:10,000 scale required extensive field data, significant financial resources, and time. Unlike the broader 1:50,000 scale maps, detailed mapping is labour-intensive. The organisation emphasised that 1:10,000 scale maps covering 10,560 sq km of the first-priority areas had already been completed, while the remaining areas were planned for mapping in the coming years. The audit also highlighted financial management concerns. Treasury allocations totalling Rs. 236,767,553 had not been utilised for the intended activities and had instead been deposited in fixed accounts as of 31 December 2024. These allocations had been intended for the landslide risk mitigation project, Sri Lanka chemical risk assessment project, resettlement programme for people living in high-risk areas with technical assistance, and the construction of office and laboratory facilities in Badulla and Kalutara. The NBRO reported that delays and late funding affected the use of allocated resources: Rs. 134 million for the landslide risk reduction project is being utilised after receiving Rs. 100 million post-August 2024, with several contracts completed or nearing completion, while Rs. 19 million for the resettlement project has seen slow spending due to implementation delays. Construction of district offices and laboratories, with Rs. 81 million allocated, has been postponed following a Government suspension of new projects. The remaining Rs. 2.4 million for the chemical risk assessment project is set to be used to finalise the project, including stakeholder consultations and policy reviews. The NAO has urged the NBRO to expedite these projects and ensure that allocated funds are fully utilised for their intended purposes. The audit further revealed gaps in the early landslide warning system. As of 31 December 2024, 330 automatic rain gauges had been installed across 14 vulnerable districts, but 67 were inactive. Of the 251 active gauges, only 192 were contributing to issuing early warnings, while 126 inactive gauges had not been reactivated. The NBRO explained that many of these gauges were over seven years old, with expired internal electronic components, making repairs costly and impractical. The organisation stated that under the Climate Resilience Multi-Phase Programmatic Approach (CresMPA), all rain gauges were scheduled for replacement, with about 200 already installed at the time of the audit. The NAO has recommended that the NBRO take urgent steps to expedite the mapping of landslide zones, ensure the full operational capacity of early warning systems, and utilise allocated funds as planned to minimise disaster risks. When contacted by The Sunday Morning , NBRO Landslide Research and Risk Management Division (LRRMD) Senior Scientist Dr. Wasantha Senadeera explained that the organisation issued regional warnings because it currently lacked the specific data needed to provide localised risk alerts. \u201cWe are issuing localised warnings only for areas where we have already identified relevant equipment, through which we collect data and provide alerts to those specific locations. At present, we do not have sufficient specific data to issue widespread localised warnings. \u201cHowever, we have already conducted awareness programmes and educated residents in risk-prone areas on how to remain vigilant during heavy rains. Collecting the data needed for localised warnings is a costly process and we are gradually working to build it,\u201d he said. Dr. Senadeera also highlighted that most landslides were manmade, noting that many people bypassed the NBRO certification process when constructing buildings. He explained that obtaining a certificate cost around Rs. 15,000, but those unable to pay could apply through the respective grama niladhari to the NBRO. Following a thorough study, the organisation issues a certificate indicating whether the area is low, medium, or high risk. Referring to satellite imagery from Cyclone Ditwah, Dr. Senadeera said that around 1,200 landslides had been identified, but approximately 900 of them did not cause any damage. \u201cMost of these disasters are due to unregulated development projects carried out across the country,\u201d he said. Responding to the NAO findings on mapping delays, Dr. Senadeera stated that the NBRO had been conducting mapping since 1985, but the slow progress was largely due to funding delays and insufficient human resources. When asked whether mapping could have prevented the recent landslide disasters in Sri Lanka, he stressed that while mapping provided an indication of low-, medium-, and high-risk areas, even low-risk zones could experience landslides during severe events, which were inherently unpredictable.

We are awaiting further feedback, and appropriate steps will be taken in accordance with established diplomatic procedures once details are confirmed,\u201d Hemachandra said. Iranian State media and Judiciary officials in the Hormozgan Province reported that the tanker was intercepted on 12 December after allegedly attempting to smuggle 6 million litres of diesel fuel. The vessel is accused of multiple violations, including disabling navigation systems and ignoring orders to stop. The detained crew reportedly consists of 18 individuals supposedly from India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. However, the exact number of Sri Lankan nationals remains unconfirmed. Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Thushara Rodrigo clarified that the Government had informed its missions in Iran and Oman and was verifying the identities of the detained crew. \u201cWe have not received contact from any next of kin of Sri Lankan crew members yet, so we are still uncertain as to the details. At this stage, we are investigating whether Sri Lankans are actually on the vessel or if there has been a misidentification,\u201d Rodrigo said. He emphasised that the safety and welfare of the Sri Lankan crew, if verified, remained a top priority. The Government has assured the public that families of the detained crew will receive support, and updates will be provided once official confirmation is received from Iranian authorities.

Hapugala. He maintained that the additional expenditure would not disrupt fiscal stability, commodity prices, or foreign reserves. Hapugala added that disaster-related spending in the coming year would be accommodated within existing fiscal frameworks, noting that significant fiscal space remained available under supplementary expenditure provisions. He said that approximately Rs. 400 billion could be mobilised through two additional expenditure ceilings without undermining the Government\u2019s overall cash position, which currently stands at around Rs. 1.3 trillion. Referring to statutory fiscal limits, Hapugala said the Public Financial Management Act permitted a budget ceiling of 13%, but stressed that exceptional circumstances such as a large-scale natural disaster allowed for limited flexibility. \u201cI think an extra 1% can be allocated in this exceptional situation,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, we can provide the necessary supplementary budgetary allocation.\u201d Addressing concerns over whether large-scale reconstruction and relief spending could lead to higher prices for essential goods, Hapugala rejected the notion that fiscal-side expenditure would translate into immediate price pressures. \u201cNo, I do not think this will have an impact. This is expenditure on the fiscal side and should not directly affect the prices of commodities like medicines or fuel,\u201d he said. On the question of foreign reserves, Hapugala said the disaster response could, in fact, have a positive effect, citing expected inflows of external budgetary support from international partners. The Treasury Deputy Secretary also responded to questions on the apparent disparity between estimated disaster losses and the funding currently identified for relief and reconstruction, indicating that discussions with multilateral institutions were ongoing. \u201cI cannot specify the exact plan at this moment. We are currently planning discussions with foreign organisations, such as the World Bank and others, to secure support. I cannot state the exact amount that will be available, but we should be able to provide clearer figures in the future,\u201d he said. When asked about the relatively small share of foreign assistance in the total disaster-related expenditure to date, Hapugala said detailed figures on expenditure composition and forecasting fell under the purview of budget authorities, adding that further clarity would emerge as discussions with external partners progressed. The Treasury\u2019s assurances come amid growing public scrutiny over the financing of disaster response efforts following Cyclone Ditwah, which caused widespread damage across multiple sectors and prompted calls for transparency on funding sources, fiscal trade-offs, and long-term recovery planning.

Speaking to The Sunday Morning , UGC Chairman Senior Professor Kapila Seneviratne said that issues highlighted by FUTA included concerns over the independence of deans and heads of departments, particularly fears that the proposed amendments would allow the removal of deans without due process. \u201cThat is not the case. If there is anyone to be removed, it will be done following a formal investigation,\u201d Seneviratne said, dismissing allegations that unchecked powers would be vested in university authorities. Concerns were also raised at a media conference organised by the Arts Faculty Teachers\u2019 Association of the University of Colombo (AFTA-CU) on Wednesday (10), where Arts Faculty lecturers claimed that the bill transferred excessive administrative authority to the Senate, thereby undermining the autonomy of deans and heads of departments. Clarifying another contentious point, Prof Seneviratne explained that in instances where a suitable candidate for the position of head of department was not available within a department, an external candidate from a relevant field may be recruited, subject to Senate approval. He noted that although this clarification was not explicitly reflected in the English version of the bill, it had been addressed during discussions on the amendment. The UGC Chairman further stated that certain operational clarifications may not be included in the act itself but would be issued through Government circulars once the act was passed, in order to avoid misinterpretation. The bill to amend the Universities Act, issued on 21 November, expands eligibility for the post of dean to include senior professors, professors, associate professors, and senior lecturers (Grade I) of the relevant faculty, to be appointed by the faculty board. The act also limits appointments to a maximum of two terms for deans. In addition, the amendment stipulates that no individual may be appointed head of the same department for more than one term, or hold the position for more than two consecutive terms. \u201cThe aim of this amendment is to extend more opportunities to members of a faculty to become dean,\u201d Prof. Seneviratne said.

Over the last week, The Sunday Morning learnt that there are dozens of Sri Lankans who have applied for dual citizenship and paid the relevant fees for it last year, with little communication from the Government since. Speaking to The Sunday Morning , Department of Immigration and Emigration Citizenship Division Deputy Controller E.H.G. Prasanga confirmed that all applications submitted in 2024 and January this year had been fully processed, and that emails requesting the relevant payments had already been sent to the applicants concerned. He said nearly 1,000 applications that were pending were now in the final stage of processing, adding that applicants would be notified within the next week to make the required payments. The department expects to complete all applications registered up to March by the end of December this year. Prasanga said the current processing time for dual citizenship applications was around 7\u20138 months, adding that steps were being taken to reduce this timeframe to 5\u20136 months. He explained that applications extending beyond one year were generally those requiring extended security clearances or those with missing documentation, and that applicants were informed when such issues arose. He further stated that once payment was made, a confirmation was issued on the same day, and the dual citizenship certificate was finalised within 6\u20137 weeks following the completion of ministerial approvals and official signatures. Prasanga stressed that only eligible applicants were requested to make the payment, noting that paying the fee marked the commencement of the final step of the process. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) stated that Sri Lankans living overseas could submit their dual citizenship applications through Sri Lankan diplomatic missions in their respective countries. When contacted, MFA Spokesperson Thushara Rodrigo said Sri Lankan missions overseas accepted applications within 1\u20132 hours once all required documents were submitted, adding that the necessary requirements were publicly available on the websites of the ministry and the Department of Immigration and Emigration. He explained that once submitted, completed applications were sent to Colombo via the diplomatic bag system and transferred to the Department of Immigration and Emigration, which then carried out the full verification process. Rodrigo argued that diplomatic missions did not cause delays, stating that what applicants often perceived as delays were actually the procedural time required by the current system. He said that all waiting periods arose from internal administrative and verification processes carried out in Sri Lanka, not from the missions abroad, adding that processing times varied depending on the nature of individual cases and whether applications contained errors or incomplete documentation. Rodrigo pointed out that a common misconception among applicants was that their application had already been approved once they were informed to make the payment, emphasising that they needed to wait for the physical certificate to exercise their rights and privileges as dual citizens.

Speaking to The Sunday Morning , NCPA Director \u2013 Planning and Information Shanika Malalgoda said that under Sri Lankan law, the Department of Probation and Child Care Services held sole authority over child custody, with the final decision resting with the courts based on the best interests and specific needs of each child. She said that all affected children were currently housed in safety centres managed by the relevant district and divisional secretariats, ensuring their protection under official supervision during the ongoing recovery phase. Malalgoda said efforts were underway to compile a complete count of children orphaned by the disaster. \u201cA combined effort of gathering data is ongoing and it will take some time.\u201d She added that the NCPA\u2019s immediate priority was the provision of psychosocial support and rescue operations for children affected by the cyclone. Emphasising the legal process involved, Malalgoda stressed that custody would be granted only through formal legal procedures, even if close relatives came forward seeking guardianship. She further said that the NCPA had expanded its mental health response services, with a focus on providing timely psychosocial care. District psychosocial officers, together with district and divisional child protection officers, are overseeing the well-being of the children. They are supported by volunteers from the University Student Ambassador National Programme (USANP), a network of trained university students who visit safety centres and schools to provide mental health assistance to children under 18. Noting that the emotional well-being of affected children remained a key concern, Malalgoda said that the NCPA was accepting donations of schoolbags, toys, stationery, footwear, warm clothing, and other essential items at its Headquarters. She added that NCPA officials had been assigned to distribute these items and expressed gratitude to individuals, businesses, and Sri Lankans living overseas for their support during this critical period. Meanwhile, as learnt by The Sunday Morning , district secretariats in the affected areas are continuing verification processes. With Kandy being one of the worst-affected districts, Kandy District Secretary Indika Udawatta told The Sunday Morning that while final figures were not available yet, a comprehensive report was expected in the coming days. Matale District Secretary Prasanna Madanayake said that although data collection was still ongoing, the district\u2019s comparatively lower death toll suggested there may be no orphaned children in the area. For child-related concerns, the NCPA\u2019s hotline 1929 remains open to the public for both disaster-related and general child protection issues. Meanwhile, Disaster Management Centre (DMC) Assistant Director Pradeep Kodippili said that the DMC was still awaiting a finalised count of orphaned children, noting that the data would be released once verified by the relevant district secretariats.

Responding to a question raised by The Daily Morning during a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday (11) at the UN in Colombo, Franche stressed that every person who had lost shelter as a result of the disaster must be provided with one. \u201cMany houses have been destroyed, and the Government needs to identify new locations for the affected families. What is important for us at the moment is to ensure that every person who does not have a roof over their heads has one,\u201d he said. He explained the Government must find alternative land for many whose homes had been destroyed, including those who had been living in unauthorised settlements. \u201cIdentifying suitable land would take time. The priority for us right now is not to resolve the entire housing and land issue. The priority is to ensure the thousands of people who have lost their homes have a roof over their heads and are protected while the Government works on immediate and long-term solutions,\u201d Franche said. Franche noted the situation remained highly complex and varied greatly depending on local conditions and the locations. \u201cIt is appropriate for homeowners to clean and rebuild where possible. However, people affected along riverbanks, for instance, where they had settled illegally, are being provided with legal settlements,\u201d he noted. He added the Government was very conscious of the need to prevent affected persons from returning to the same unsafe locations and facing similar risks in future disasters. \u201cIt is therefore important for the authorities to find solutions \u2014 either by relocating them to State-owned land or through alternatives provided by the Housing Ministry\u201d. Referring to the situation in the hill country, where landslides had caused extensive destruction, Franche said that a significant number of houses had been damaged and access roads blocked. \u201cHere too, the solutions will differ. But, the focus must be on clearing the large debris and reopening roads so that people can regain access to their homes.\u201d Moreover, he noted the world is not well prepared for such disaster situations. We are seeing a reduction in financing for the humanitarian response, he lamented. He said that countries had other priorities. \u201cClearly, around the world, we are seeing more and more extreme weather including cyclones and floods. It is clear that in the next decade the world is going to suffer a lot more of these disasters. And, we are not prepared,\u201d he lamented further. Franche said the UN was advocating not only to build back better but also to build back in a way that is climate-resilient.\u00a0\u201cThat is why it is so important the Government does not allow people to resettle in areas that are vulnerable to flooding. \u201cWe should also build this kind of protection on the sides of the Kelaniya and other rivers so that people are protected from future flooding\u201d.

Speaking to The Daily Morning , the Ministry Secretary Nalaka Kaluwewa said that 147 schools are still being used as temporary shelters following the recent floods and landslides, but that District Secretaries have assured the Ministry they are working to clear most of them in the coming days. \u201cExcept for a few schools, many of the centres set up in school premises are now being cleared,\u201d he said, adding that any schools that cannot be cleared in time will remain closed.  He explained that several of these schools have relatively small student populations, around 50, 100 or 200 children, and that in such cases, the zonal authorities would combine classes or merge schools to continue teaching. \u201cThese are decisions that must be taken on the ground. It is not practical for us to manage this from Colombo. So, we have instructed the zonal authorities to take the necessary steps. Different arrangements will be in place depending on the local conditions.\"  The Ministry earlier announced that all schools in the Western, Southern, Northern, Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and North-Central Provinces will reopen on 16 December. Out of the 10,076 schools countrywide, 9,929 will reportedly resume academic activities on that day. Principals, teachers and non-academic staff attached to these schools must report for duty on 15 December. A flexible dress policy will also be in place for students and staff in the disaster-affected areas. Meanwhile, the subjects of the 2025 General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (GCE A/L) Examination, which were postponed due to adverse weather conditions, will now be conducted from 12 January of next year (2026) to 20 January. Accordingly, the Examinations Commissioner General Indika Kumari Liyanage has released the amended timetable for the said Examination. If school candidates affected by the disaster are unable to appear for the Examination at their designated Examination centre, they should inform the principal of their respective school. Accordingly, the principals are required to notify the Zonal Education Director and the Exams Commissioner (School Examinations and Results) if there are any disaster-affected candidates in their school. Similarly, if disaster-affected private candidates are unable to appear for the Examination at their assigned Examination centre, they are instructed to inform via the following telephone numbers (hotline - 1911, telephones - 0112784537, 0112786616 and 0112784208, and fax - 0112784422) or electronic mail address ( gcealexam@gmail.com ). The Examinations Department noted that if there is any issue regarding the A/L Examination, the public can report them by contacting the Department\u2019s hotline or through the said telephone numbers or fax or email. Further, no A/L Examination answer sheets have been damaged as a result of the recent floods and landslides across the country, Liyanage has stated. Elsewhere, all preschools and early childhood development centres that were closed due to the emergency disaster situation and are now deemed safe to resume operations will be reopened from 16 December, the National Secretariat for Early Childhood Development has announced. Also, digital learning platforms have been strengthened to support continued learning, recognising the challenges faced by students due to the unexpected disaster caused by Cyclone Ditwah. Access to the national digital education platform, \u2018E-Thaksalawa\u2019, has been enhanced, enabling students to access subject materials and past papers from anywhere. This initiative allows students to continue preparing for examinations despite school closures and other disruptions. From February 2026, these digital learning resources will also be made available to GCE Ordinary Level (O/L) students.

Bandara, responding to queries from The Daily Morning yesterday (11), said that they had not yet been informed of any such move by the GNs of alleged political interference or of a decision to resort to trade union (TU) action. He noted however the majority of the workload lies with Government officers, voluntary organisations, and service personnel. He claimed that GNs were not even required to identify persons in distress. According to Government officials, the Disaster Management Centre, the Tri-Forces, the National Disaster Management Committee, and frontline Government officers such as the GNs are currently engaged in distributing relief. Meanwhile, the GN Officers\u2019 Alliance warned that it was contemplating launching a strike if political interference in disaster relief distribution continued. They stated that pressure from various groups, including Government politicians, was hindering officers as they manage relief efforts and temporary shelters. The GN Officers' TU has warned of impending TU action if political interference in State relief programmes does not cease immediately. Speaking to The Daily Morning , the Convenor of the GN Officers TU Alliance, Jagath Chandralal alleged that certain politicians are actively distorting the distribution process. He claimed that some Parliamentarians are circulating official aid application forms among their supporters, instructing them that the documents require a political signature to be valid. Chandralal cited a specific letter from the Badulla District Secretary, which he claimed instructed that relief application formats must be confirmed with the relevant regional political leader. \u201cThere is a legal procedure to launch relief programmes and distribute disaster relief aid to the public,\u201d Chandralal stated. \u201cThe National Disaster Relief Service Centre has provided a format to collect data. According to that, the GNs, officers from the Economic Development units of regional secretariats, and the Disaster Management officers should jointly investigate and verify the process. Yet, this transparent process is being intervened on by political forces.\u201d He further alleged that the coordinating secretaries of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, who have been appointed as presidents of the Praja Shakthi Committee scheme, are pressuring GN officers and obstructing their work. Chandralal emphasised that these committees were established for regional development and have no official role in disaster relief operations.

When the matter was taken up before High Court No. 6, counsel for the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) informed the Court that the Commission would withdraw all indictments pursuant to a submission made under Section 67 of the new Anti-Corruption Act by President\u2019s Counsel Dilan Ratnayake, appearing for Cabraal. While withdrawing the charges, the Commission sought Rs. 1.8 billion in damages from Cabraal alone, adding that the case would be refiled if the damages were not settled in three months. However, High Court Judge Mohomed Mihal, after hearing submissions from Ratnayake and counsel for the other accused, ruled that all charges be dismissed forthwith. The accused were discharged unconditionally. In his legal submission to the Commission, Ratnayake argued that the corruption charges could not stand in law or on evidence. He said the investment decision was made collectively by officers empowered under the Monetary Law Act and that there was no material to show an intention or knowledge to cause wrongful loss to the State. He cited statements from then-Deputy Governor (now Governor) Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe describing the Monetary Board\u2019s collective investment process, and a 2018 confirmation from former Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy that the Greek Bond purchase had adhered to applicable reserve-management guidelines. Ratnayake also pointed to the CBSL\u2019s substantial profits from reserves management in 2010 and 2011 of $ 341 million and $ 430 million, respectively, noting that these returns were achieved by the same officers involved in the disputed transaction, undermining any suggestion of intent to cause loss. He argued that, at most, the allegation amounted to an error of judgment and not a criminal act. He further submitted that the Monetary Law Act provides statutory protection for actions taken in good faith, and that no evidence of misconduct or wilful default had been presented to remove that protection. The defence also relied on a 2014 Supreme Court determination dismissing a fundamental rights challenge over the same investment, in which the Court held it could not conclude that the Monetary Board acted arbitrarily or in a fraudulent manner. Ratnayake told the Court that allowing the indictment to proceed would result in a futile and protracted trial unsupported by evidence, and urged that it be withdrawn under Section 67 of the Anti-Corruption Act. The High Court\u2019s order yesterday brings the proceedings to an end.

The SEC approval is in response to the mandatory offer that Mazagon is required to make following the pending Rights Issue of Colombo Dockyard, in terms of the Takeovers and Mergers Code. Last October, Colombo Dockyard announced plans for a Rs. 13 billion Rights Issue and noted that its major shareholder, Onomichi Dockyard Company Ltd., will not renounce its rights in favour of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd., but will refrain from subscribing. The resulting rights entitlement will be allotted to Mazagon subject to shareholder approval by Special Resolution. The issue will take place on the basis of nine new shares for every two held at a price of Rs. 40 per share, resulting in the issuance of 323,365,158 new shares. The company said the proceeds are intended to strengthen its financial position and improve working capital in view of the financial constraints it continues to face. The funds are also expected to support ongoing operational and financial obligations. Yesterday, Colombo Dockyard closed up at Rs. 217, compared to the previous closing price of Rs. 174. As of end-September 2025, Onomichi Dockyard was the top shareholder with a 51% stake, followed by the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund at 10%. The company reported a net asset value per share of Rs. 8.75 for the same period, down from Rs. 52.41 a year earlier. The SEC has also deferred a trading suspension on Colombo Dockyard PLC shares to 11 June 2026. The suspension was initially meant to take effect today (11). Colombo Dockyard said the extension is subject to the conditions set out in an SEC letter dated 10 December 2025.

While affirming that the United States stands ready to provide any necessary support to assist Sri Lanka\u2019s post-Ditwah recovery, Hooker expressed support for enhancing tourism between the United States and Sri Lanka, as well as for the growth of trade and maritime operations between the two nations. Furthermore, she said the US would support Sri Lanka\u2019s initiatives to combat drug-related issues. In October, long before Cyclone Ditwa, the Asian Development Bank warned that Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery will face pressure in 2026 as new US tariffs on apparel and rubber exports start to bite. While growth this year and in 2025 is expected to hold at 3.9% on the back of manufacturing, construction and services, the ADB projects a slowdown to around 3.3% in 2026 as external demand weakens and job losses filter through. The report noted that US tariff rates have climbed to their highest levels since the 1930s, pushing Sri Lanka\u2019s effective tariff burden sharply higher. IPS separately estimated that the 20% reciprocal tariff could cut export earnings by $634 million and threaten nearly 16,000 apparel-sector jobs. The ADB said risks to the outlook remain elevated, citing trade-policy uncertainty, energy-price volatility, Middle East remittance exposure, global demand softness and domestic weather disruptions. Earlier this week, US-based Newsweek published an interview with President Dissanayake where he said Sri Lanka wanted market access, climate financing and technology partnerships with the US. \u201cWhat we offer (the US) is a strategically placed, stable, democratic partner in the Indo Pacific.\u201d    Editorial : +94 0112 479 356 ,  +94 0112 479 780 +94 0112 447 848 Technical : +94 011 247 9437 helpdesk@wijeya.lk webadsupport@wijeya.lk Marketing : +94 011 247 9540 +94 011 247 9873 Web Advertising Inquiry : Dilan : +94 77 372 7288 Print Advertising : Chameen Dayarathne, Manager - Marketing, : 076 928 5885 / 011 247 9597 : chameend@wijeya.lk Mr Channa Jayasinghe, Marketing Manager & Sales, : +94 777 880 155 : channaj@wijeya.lk All the content on this website is copyright protected and can be reproduced only by giving the due courtesy to 'ft.lk' Copyright \ufffd 2004 Wijeya Newspapers Ltd.

The annual awards by The Banker evaluate global banks on financial strength, innovation, governance, and long-term strategic performance. The recognition follows a year in which HNB delivered steady progress in balance sheet health, customer solutions, and operational efficiency despite a challenging operating environment. HNB MD/CEO Damith Pallewatte said: \u201cThis award recognises the progress we are making as a bank that supports national recovery and long-term growth. Our focus is on strengthening balance sheet stability, improving service reliability, and expanding digital and advisory solutions that help customers move forward with confidence. Every achievement is the result of disciplined execution by our teams and the trust placed in us by our customers and partners.\u201d The award caps a year of significant milestones for HNB, including stronger capital and liquidity positions, improvements in asset quality, growth in Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) and transaction banking, and wider adoption of the bank\u2019s digital platforms. Furthermore, a key highlight was the successful acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in HNB Investment Bank, reinforcing HNB\u2019s commitment to expanding its investment banking capabilities. The bank continued to support key sectors of the economy through structured lending, advisory support, and partnerships aimed at improving competitiveness and financial inclusion. HNB also strengthened its operational resilience through process redesign, data-driven decision-making, and improvements in customer experience across branches and digital touchpoints. These efforts have contributed to more stable performance indicators and a more agile foundation for future growth. As Sri Lanka\u2019s financial sector shifts towards modernised services and more transparent governance, HNB has positioned itself as a bank committed to long-term stability, digital progress, and customer-focused innovation. The recognition from The Banker places the institution among top-performing banks in the region and reflects its continued role in supporting the country\u2019s economic trajectory. With over 255 customer centres, HNB stands as one of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest and most technologically innovative private sector banks.

Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit, IFC\u2019s South Asia Regional Director Imad Fakhoury outlined why the institution continues to maintain a strong and diversified presence in the country despite recent economic shocks. \u201cSri Lanka cannot get rich by looking inward,\u201d he implied, calling for a continued push toward competitiveness, investment attraction and export-oriented growth. IFC says... He said Sri Lanka must redesign its global investment brand after years of stop-start progress and recurring economic crises. \u201cSri Lanka has an incredible paradox. On one hand, it\u2019s a great development success story with strong social indicators, low poverty, and one of the highest per-capita incomes in South Asia. But we also have had a lot of economic crises, the last in 2022,\u201d he observed. Fakhoury urged policymakers and the private sector to shift the country\u2019s international positioning. \u201cSri Lanka has to position itself as a green sustainable brand, as an outward-looking brand, as an export-driven brand,\u201d he said. He opined that this direction, supports the country\u2019s ambition to serve as a major transshipment hub, while creating \u201cislands of excellence\u201d in digital services, agribusiness, specialised manufacturing and diversified tourism. However, he noted that none of this potential can be realised without policy consistency. \u201cThe branding going forward should really pivot and focus on the brands I\u2019ve mentioned, while working hard on policy predictability and continuously improving the doing-business environment,\u201d he added. He highlighted opportunities to expand high-value tourism niches, unlock new destinations in the north and east, and scale digital-services exports. The IFC currently has a long-term finance portfolio of around $ 270 million in Sri Lanka and investments across roughly a dozen companies, in addition to a stream of short-term financing, advisory engagements and blended instruments. \u201cAs IFC, we are an international development finance institution, the largest in the world in terms of supporting and investing with the private sector across developing regions,\u201d Fakhoury said. He noted that from fiscal year 2021 to the end of fiscal year 2026, the IFC\u2019s combined long-term and short-term financing, across funded and unfunded instruments, is expected to reach $ 16 billion globally. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely bullish,\u201d he said, noting that Sri Lanka remains an important part of the IFC\u2019s South Asia strategy. Fakhoury said IFC sees continued opportunity in strengthening financial inclusion, with a major focus on expanding financing for SMEs, MSMEs, and women-owned or women-led enterprises. \u201cSustainability finance and trade finance are critical areas,\u201d he said, adding that capital-market development and innovative financial instruments will remain high priorities in Sri Lanka. In the real economy, the IFC is eyeing growth in agribusiness, responsible tourism, export-oriented sectors, decarbonisation of manufacturing, and value-added production, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals. \u201cWe see promising pipeline opportunities going forward,\u201d he said. On infrastructure, he described the organisation as \u201cvery bullish\u201d on renewable energy, energy efficiency, mobility, ports, and logistics. The IFC is also working with the public arm of the World Bank Group to reform markets and enable private investment. \u201cPublic-private partnerships (PPPs) will be a critical modality given the financing needs and the limitations on fiscal space,\u201d he stressed. He also said the IFC is additionally expanding work around technology and innovation. \u201cOur work on helping the start-up ecosystem is significant. \u201cWe have been investing and identifying opportunities for disruptive technology startups,\u201d he added.

The prestigious awards, considered the highest national accolade for export excellence, recognised companies that made outstanding contributions to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth during the 2024/2025 financial year. This year\u2019s ceremony conferred 107 awards across two major categories\u201415 overall awards and 92 sectoral awards\u2014alongside merit awards determined by a panel of judges based on applicants\u2019 performance and industry impact. Sectoral evaluations extended beyond export earnings, taking into account criteria such as market diversification, employment generation, growth momentum, repatriation of export proceeds, environmental sustainability, CSR initiatives and value addition. A significant number of applications were received this year, reflecting the high level of interest and competition within the export community. The Technical Committee carried out the initial assessments, while a distinguished panel of judges chaired by a retired Supreme Court judge selected the final winners. Ernst & Young (EY) served as the Knowledge Partner for the event. The Government noted that the Presidential Export Awards align with its policy framework to expand and strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s export sector. Authorities emphasised the importance of initiatives by exporters in product and market diversification, innovation, brand building, value addition and the development of regional value chains as part of efforts to boost overall export performance in the coming years. Award winners received a trophy or plaque and a certificate, and they are permitted to use the Presidential Export Awards logo as a promotional tool for three years. This year\u2019s ceremony was organised by the EDB under the leadership of Chairman and CEO Mangala Wijesinghe, with guidance from Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Minister Sunil Handunneththi, Deputy Minister Chathuranga Abeysinghe and Ministry Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara. People\u2019s Bank served as the Platinum Sponsor, while the Sri Lanka Tea Board and the Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation joined as Silver Sponsors. Launched in 1981, the Presidential Export Awards program has now honoured export excellence for over four decades. The 27th edition drew around 1,500 attendees, including Cabinet Ministers, diplomats, senior Government officials and leading exporters.

The Government has imposed sharply higher upfront costs on the liquor industry under Excise Notification No. 03/2025, effective from yesterday (12), introducing a new one-time, non-refundable Industry Entry Fee alongside revised annual licence fees and security deposits. Standard distillery licences, manufacturers of country-made foreign liquor and malt liquor will now be subject to a Rs. 25 million Industry Entry Fee per licence. Palmrah arrack distilleries face a lower entry fee of Rs. 5 million. Liquor bottling licences have been made significantly more capital-intensive, with a Rs. 5 million Industry Entry Fee, an annual licence fee of Rs. 5 million, and a security deposit of Rs. 10 million. Retail licences to sell liquor outside premises now attract entry fees ranging from Rs. 10 million to Rs. 15 million, with the highest charge applying to supermarkets and large grocery chains regardless of location. Wholesale liquor licences carry entry fees of up to Rs. 2.5 million. Existing licensees must top up security deposits to the new thresholds within 30 days, while earlier fee regulations issued in 2017, 2018 and 2024 have been repealed. The new regulations, made under Sections 32 and 25 of the Excise Ordinance, received Parliamentary approval on 5 December 2025 and scheduled to come into force yesterday (12).

The approval allows the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to invite proposals under the International Competitive Procurement Procedure and to lease the property for 99-years, based on a valuation by the Government Chief Assessor. The land parcel, measuring 02 roods and 23.1 perches and located on Perahera Mawatha, Kollupitiya was earlier approved for disposal in September 2024 for a mixed development project, including residential components. However, the Standing Negotiations Committee recommended terminating the lease after the selected investor failed to fulfil the agreed development conditions. Following this, the UDA Board of Management on 4 September 2025 authorised the re-calling of proposals to ensure the land is utilised for a suitable development initiative. A special Cabinet-appointed committee on UDA land disposal has now endorsed calling for new investment proposals for hotel or commercial development, with the option to allocate up to 50% of the land for residential use. It is expected that the revised procurement process to attract credible investors capable of executing a high-value project on one of Colombo\u2019s most sought-after urban locations. The proposal to this effect was submitted by Urban Development Minister Bimal Rathnayake.

Earlier this week, the Colombo High Court gave permission to discharge Cabraal on condition he compensates the Sri Lanka Central Bank for losses it incurred by investing in the bonds. The Court gave Cabraal three months to transfer a little over Rs. 1.8 billion to the CBSL\u2019s account.\u00a0 He risks being indicted further if he violates the Court order. Cabraal, who was the Governor of the Central Bank between 1 July 2006 to 8 January 2015, is accused of causing a loss of over Rs. 1.8 billion to the Sri Lanka Government by investing in the Bonds. In representations made to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) Cabraal\u2019s lawyer said although his client\u2019s participation in the decision to invest in Greek bonds cannot be denied, he did not have the requisite intent or knowledge to cause a wrongful or unlawful loss to the Government. The representations emphasise the collective nature of the decision making that took place in the Central Bank with Cabraal\u2019s lawyer stating, \u201chis client acted based on the recommendations of his Deputy Governors and senior officers and there is no evidence whatsoever he acted arbitrarily.\u201d While highlighting that the CBSL\u2019s documented records which point to overall yield profitability is a testimony to the bona fides of his client and the Monetary Board, the representations invoke the statutory protection for his client under the Monetary Law Act for acts done in good faith. Meanwhile, in a statement issued on 10 December the CIABOC said it had agreed to withdraw the indictment against Cabraal, the first accused in the case, on condition he pays compensation of Rs. 1,843,267,595.65 to the Central Bank. The legal provision for this is s. 67 (3) of the Anti-Corruption Act 2023. Cabraal and four other senior Central Bank officers were indicted in the High Court for conspiracy to commit the offence of corruption under Sri Lanka\u2019s bribery legislation.\u00a0 Cabraal himself was individually indicted for the offence for his alleged role in investing in Greek Government bonds between 16.03. 2011 and 29,11,2012. The CIABOC statement went on to say that steps will be taken to indict Cabraal further under s. 67 (5) of the Act if he fails to pay the compensation. The indictment was withdrawn under s. 67 (1) of the Act. The four other accused in the case were acquitted under the provisions of the Penal Code.

The retained loss figure is as at 31 July 2025. To rectify this and tidy the balance sheet, the Directors have proposed reducing stated capital from over Rs. 9.93 billion to Rs. 2.33 billion, enabling the full set-off of carry-forward losses. The company said the adjustment will not change the number of issued and fully paid shares, which remains at 962,573,191. Softlogic Finance confirmed that it has received written approval from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka under Section 18(2) of the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011. The company stressed that the reduction does not involve any return of funds to shareholders and will not affect ownership or voting rights. It added that the proposal, subject to the required corporate approvals, is intended to strengthen its capital position and support the resumption of dividend distributions when profitability improves. Softlogic Capital PLC is the major shareholder at 92.53% on a public float of 5.08%. Softlogic Finance reported a net assets value per share at Rs. 3.06 as of end-September 2025. It reported an after-tax profit of Rs. 7.38 million for the six months to end-September 2025, down sharply from Rs. 37.9 million a year ago. For the year to end-March 2025, the company reported an after-tax profit of Rs. 145 million, the first time the bottom line was in green since 2019.

It aims to do this by simplifying processes, improving public awareness, and strengthening institutional commitment and capacity. The direction came during a special discussion held on Tuesday on \u201cMeasures to be taken to widen the tax net in accordance with the Government\u2019s tax policy.\u201d The meeting was chaired by Deputy Economic Development Minister U.D. Nishantha Jayaweera, with the participation of Inland Revenue Department (IRD) Commissioner General Rukdevi Fernando and senior officials. During the discussion, the Deputy Minister stressed the need to motivate the public to voluntarily comply with tax obligations. He called for a structured short-, medium-, and long-term program aimed at increasing awareness among taxpayers and encouraging them to file returns on their own initiative. Officials were instructed to prioritise educational outreach and to remove barriers that discourage compliance. Jayaweera also directed the IRD to simplify tax return procedures, minimising the inconvenience faced by taxpayers when submitting documents. He underscored the importance of creating a system that is easier to navigate, noting that simplification is critical to improving compliance levels and public trust. The meeting also focused on the IRD\u2019s revenue targets for 2026, with discussions focusing on current needs, resource gaps, and the Government\u2019s support to strengthen revenue collection. Officials were asked to submit a practical and urgent implementation plan to ensure that next year\u2019s goals are met. Reaffirming the Government\u2019s commitment to strengthening tax administration, the Deputy Minister urged officials to carry out their responsibilities with full dedication. He noted that the Government is addressing administrative issues and providing necessary facilities to officers to ensure that the IRD can deliver maximum service to the tax-paying public. During the first nine months of 2025, fiscal performance continued to strengthen, with the Budget deficit more than halving in the first nine months of 2025, according to the Finance Ministry\u2019s latest Fiscal Review Report. The deficit fell 54.5% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs. 441.4 billion in the first nine months of 2025 from Rs. 970 billion a year earlier, mainly due to higher revenue collections, which grew 31% YoY to Rs. 3.83 trillion from Rs. 2.93 trillion. The primary account surplus more than doubled to Rs. 1.4 trillion. Income tax revenue rose 12% to Rs. 831 billion, while VAT brought in Rs. 1.24 trillion, up 31% from a year earlier. Customs accounted for nearly half of total tax receipts, collecting Rs. 1.7 trillion and achieving 80% of its annual target.

Kidd, who leads operations for the world\u2019s largest adventure travel company across over 120 destinations, said Sri Lanka already possesses \u201cremarkable natural, cultural and human advantages\u201d that are driving rapid growth for Intrepid. Delivering the keynote during the \u2018Tourism - How can we finally market Sri Lanka as a tourist destination?\u2019 session of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organised by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce last week, she noted that Sri Lanka broke into the company\u2019s global top 10 destinations for the first time in 2024, with arrivals doubling that year and growing a further 50% each in 2025 and 2026. \u201cSri Lanka has a diversity of attractions; beautiful landscapes, rich culture and iconic biodiversity and most importantly, warm and welcoming people. With peace and stability, Sri Lanka has much to offer. But now is the time to determine what future Sri Lanka wants for tourism and to learn from examples around the world,\u201d she said. Kidd stressed that tourism\u2019s global footprint makes responsible practices essential. With one in 10 workers worldwide earning a livelihood from tourism, she said the industry, when well-managed, can preserve heritage, conserve biodiversity, distribute wealth and foster \u201cpeople-to-people diplomacy\u201d in an increasingly polarised world. But she warned that these benefits \u201cdo not just happen\u201d and can be quickly reversed when volumes exceed capacity. Citing global data, she noted that tourism accounts for over 10% of global carbon emissions, while rising anti-tourism protests from Europe to Japan and Indonesia are a reminder of the consequences of unmanaged visitor flows, disrespectful behaviour and infrastructure being diverted away from local needs. \u201cThese are warning signs that Sri Lanka must learn from,\u201d she said, adding that strategic tourism planning and destination management are needed to determine appropriate carrying capacities, prioritise quality over unchecked volume and ensure both economic and experiential value. She said Sri Lanka\u2019s wide product diversity; beaches, culture, wildlife, outdoor adventure and wellness should be seen as a competitive strength, not a branding dilemma. The variety \u201chas something for everyone,\u201d she said, noting that it enables year-round offerings, geographic dispersal and higher-value segments such as food tourism, family travel and premium experiences. Emerging global travel trends, she said, further strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s position. \u201cSafety and security remain the top consideration, affordability is second, and the third is sustainability,\u201d she explained, citing Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) data showing travellers are actively avoiding overcrowded destinations and preferring shoulder seasons, alternative cities and authentic cultural experiences. She said Intrepid\u2019s own research shows that 74% of its customers want meaningful community connections, something Sri Lanka can offer effortlessly. However, Kidd cautioned that sustainability expectations are now shaping competitiveness. She pointed to data from Europe showing that a third of travellers may change destinations if sustainability standards are lacking. Countries like T\u00fcrkey and Singapore have adopted Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) criteria nationally, while investors increasingly require sustainability credentials to unlock grants, concessional financing and technical support. She stressed that protecting Sri Lanka\u2019s natural and cultural assets, its biodiversity, heritage sites and local traditions must be \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d. \u201cIf these are degraded, the industry will suffer long term,\u201d she warned, raising concerns about waste, water management, ethical wildlife tourism and the strain on historic sites. \u201cIf the answer to any of these questions is no, it will impact the experience of travellers and the reputation of the destination,\u201d she pointed out. Kidd also highlighted the need for greater community inclusion, particularly for women who make most global travel decisions yet occupy less than 10% of visible industry roles in Sri Lanka, and only about 3% of guiding positions. \u201cWomen have incredible stories to tell,\u201d she said, noting that tourism involvement expands economic benefits across families and communities. She said Intrepid has used partnerships to model how sustainability, community empowerment and tourism growth can reinforce each other. Through the Intrepid Foundation, the company works with Zero Plastic Movement to tackle waste and advocate regulatory reform. It also integrates electric vehicles into its supply chain to reduce emissions and partners with the Market Development Facility (MDF) Australia on women-focused training programs. \u201cThese are examples of how we strive to create positive change through the joy of travel and sustain the destinations that are so important to us,\u201d she said. Kidd said to a top panel which featured Sri Lanka Tourism Chairman Buddhika Hewawasam that the time is here to \u201cnot only plan for the future, but start implementing practical steps.\u201d \u201cThe Government must guide the direction through regulation and support, while public\u2013private collaboration makes it work. If strong destination management is created as the foundation, marketing becomes clear and value-driven, attracting travellers who will respect and contribute to Sri Lanka,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s ensure that this island paradise delivers on its promise, by protecting what makes it special and delivering tourism that benefits both the traveller and the people of Sri Lanka,\u201d Kidd stressed.

The funds will be drawn from the Consolidated Fund or any other State-held finances, including loans secured at the discretion of the Government, for use within the 2025 financial year. In the wake of the Ditwah-related natural disasters that pummelled the country, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake last week urged Parliament to convene before the official commencement in January 2026 to approve the Rs. 50 billion estimate for 2025. He also said the Government would submit another supplementary estimate for Rs. 500 billion in January to finance relief and recovery spending in 2026. Additionally, the Committee approved regulations issued under Section 71 of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002, as published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2460/44. The Committee also convened on 3 December 2025 to review several key regulatory and financial matters, including new regulations issued under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Act, the National Audit Office\u2019s Annual Work Programme for 2026, and the Final Report on the Appropriation Bill for the 2026 financial year. During its deliberations on the NMRA regulations published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2452/39 of 4 September 2025, the Committee underscored the need to enhance system-wide transparency and visibility in the medicine registration process. Following its review, the CoPF approved the regulations. The Committee also examined the National Audit Office\u2019s Annual Work Programme for 2026, which outlines a total of 3,508 audits scheduled for the year. These include 3,484 financial audits, 11 performance audits, one environmental audit and 12 special audits. A significant addition for 2026 is the inclusion of Samurdhi Community-Based Banks and Samurdhi Community-Based Bank Societies under the Auditor General\u2019s audit mandate. The Committee raised concerns over staffing capacity to absorb the new workload. The Acting Auditor General informed members that an additional 10\u201315% staff would be required beyond the existing cadre, with pilot audits currently underway through regional offices. These pilots will continue until the end of February 2026, after which the exact human resource requirement whether through recruitment or outsourcing will be determined. The CoPF agreed to advise the Speaker that it supports the potential outsourcing of the Samurdhi-related audit work, subject to further evaluation by the Auditor General. The National Audit Office has been directed to complete its pilot project and report findings to the Committee by end-February 2026. The Committee also reviewed the Final Report submitted under Standing Order 121(5)(ii) on the Appropriation Bill for the 2026 financial year, capturing its observations and recommendations on ministerial Budget proposals and expenditure allocations. Several Members of Parliament serving on the CoPF were present at both meetings.

The program brings together Artificial Intelligence and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to strengthen early warning systems, improve emergency response and enhance long-term planning. The event commenced with a one-minute silence in memory of the victims of Cyclone Ditwah, last month\u2019s devastating storm that caused widespread flooding. The disaster affected over one million people, claimed hundreds of lives and has been described as the worst catastrophe to hit Sri Lanka since the 2004 tsunami. The destruction has also slowed the country\u2019s economic recovery, with major rebuilding efforts still underway across affected districts. Delivering the welcome address, ADRIMP President Sarath Premalal emphasised the urgency for innovation: \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s climate risks are increasing every year. GeoAI gives us the opportunity to think ahead to forecast hazards more accurately and ensure our responders have the knowledge and technology needed to save lives.\u201d More than 20 Government officials and 125 university students have joined the yearlong program, supported by the US Embassy in Sri Lanka, which aims to train a new generation of disaster-tech specialists through advanced GeoAI learning. GeoAI Project Lead Dr. Novil Wijesekara highlighted the program\u2019s transformative potential: \u201cOur goal is not only to introduce new tools but to strengthen the entire ecosystem, from real-time data to predictive models, so Sri Lanka can shift from reactive disaster response to proactive, intelligence-driven preparedness.\u201d Dr. Wijesekara urges Sri Lanka to pair innovation with human commitment, highlighting that technology can guide recovery but people drive it. Digital Economy Ministry Acting Secretary Waruna Sri Dhanapala underscored the importance of digital readiness: \u201cDigital transformation is central to Sri Lanka\u2019s future. GeoAI will unify fragmented data, strengthen inter-agency coordination and enable rapid decision-making during national emergencies.\u201d Disaster Management Centre Director General Major General Sampath Kotuwegoda stressed operational impact: \u201cEvery minute matters during a disaster. Tools like GeoAI can give our teams the critical lead time needed during floods, landslides and cyclones. This initiative will directly support our frontline responders.\u201d US Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Jayne A. Howell, who also served as the chief guest reaffirmed the United States\u2019 continued support: \u201cInvesting in these young minds is investing in Sri Lanka\u2019s safer future. The United States is proud to support this initiative, which strengthens early warning systems, enhances emergency response and builds long-term national resilience.\u201d University of Colombo Vice Chancellor Prof. Indika Mahesh Karunathilaka, who was the guest of honour, spoke on the role of youth in national recovery: \u201cThis program will empower our youth with greater vigilance and advanced skills. It is the young people of Sri Lanka who are now rebuilding, both financially and physically after the devastation of Cyclone Ditwah. Their contribution is vital and GeoAI will further strengthen their ability to support the country in times of crisis.\u201d The launch brought together technical agencies and development partners. Over the coming year, students will receive training in hazard mapping, drone data analysis, predictive modelling and real-time emergency response applications. As climate-driven disasters intensify globally and locally, the GeoAI initiative is expected to play a critical role in strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s preparedness, enhancing inter-agency coordination and positioning the nation as a regional leader in AI-powered disaster resilience.

The project, titled \u201cIntegration of the Natural Capital Value of the Coastal and Marine Ecosystems in Sri Lanka with the Sustainable Development Plans,\u201d will be executed over four years in selected coastal regions of Galle, Mannar, Puttalam and Trincomalee. The initiative was jointly developed by the Environment Ministry and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with support from other relevant agencies and received approval under the GEF\u2019s seventh funding cycle. The Cabinet of Ministers also authorised the signing of a formal agreement between the Environment Ministry and the IUCN to proceed with project implementation. Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa noted that although many environmentally conscious nations have already quantified the value of their natural capital, Sri Lanka has yet to undertake such assessments in a comprehensive or quantitative manner. \u201cThe new project is expected to fill this gap, supporting more informed planning and enabling coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, lagoons and sea grass beds, to be factored into economic and development decision-making,\u201d he said at the weekly post-Cabinet meeting media briefing on Thursday. He said the project will enhance long-term conservation efforts while strengthening resilience in coastal districts that are increasingly vulnerable to climate-related pressures.

Addressing the media following Sri Lanka\u2019s worst natural disaster in two decades, UN Resident Coordinator Marc-Andr\u00e9 Franche said extreme weather is becoming more frequent and intense across the globe, yet preparedness, both nationally and internationally has not kept pace. \u201cI would say that the world is not very well prepared for this. We are seeing more and more extreme weather events, cyclones, flash floods and it is clear that in the next years and the next decades, the world is going to suffer a lot more of these disasters, and we are not prepared,\u201d he said. Franche noted that countries are increasingly struggling to cope with overlapping crises, while global humanitarian financing is shrinking as Governments divert Budgets to competing domestic priorities. He acknowledged that Sri Lanka faces stiff competition for international funding, as countries across the region including Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand grapple with simultaneous climate-related disasters, while major humanitarian crises continue in Sudan, Gaza and Yemen. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time where we had so many emergencies at the same time,\u201d he stressed. Franche urged Governments including Sri Lanka to use the aftermath of disasters as a turning point to rebuild stronger, safer and climate-smart infrastructure rather than replicate past vulnerabilities. The UN Resident Coordinator asserted the need for climate-resilient rebuilding and avoiding resettlement in high-risk areas. \u201cSome communities already knew they lived in zones historically prone to flooding. People should not be living there, period,\u201d he said, adding that other areas will require mitigation measures rather than relocation. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is so important that the Government does not allow people to resettle in areas that are vulnerable to flooding. We need to build protections on the sides of the Kelani River and the hundreds of rivers in Sri Lanka, so people are protected from future flooding,\u201d he added. He said weather shocks are becoming more common and more extensive, and the economic and human toll will surge unless countries urgently redesign their development models around climate resilience. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s no one solution. I think we need to use all the tools at the disposal of the Government, to find a multiplicity of solutions,\u201d he noted. He opined that proactive investment is far cheaper than repeated post-disaster relief and reconstruction. \u201cThis is a priority everywhere.

The program aims to transfer excess water from the Mahaweli River to the drier northern and northwestern parts of Sri Lanka. The Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program Stage 2 Project will directly benefit more than 35,600 farming households in the North Central Province by strengthening agriculture sector resilience and enhancing food security. The ADB leads the joint co-financing effort for the project, which is expected to mobilise $ 60 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development and $ 42 million from the International Fund for Agricultural Development, in addition to the ADB financing. \u201cWhile Sri Lanka has reduced food insecurity, it remains a development challenge for the country,\u201d said ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono. \u201cHigher agricultural productivity and crop diversification are necessary to achieve food security, and adequate water resources and disaster-resilient irrigation systems are key.\u201d The project will complete the Government\u2019s North Central Province Canal (NCPC) irrigation infrastructure, which is expected to irrigate about 14,912 hectares (ha) of paddy fields and provide reliable irrigated water for commercial agriculture development (CAD). It will help complete the construction of tunnels and open and covered canals. The project will also establish a supervisory control and data acquisition system to improve NCPC operations. Once completed, the NCPC will connect the Moragahakanda Reservoir to the reservoirs of Huruluwewa, Manankattiya, Eruwewa, and Mahakanadarawa. The CAD component will construct 13 pressurised pipe distribution networks to provide reliable and efficient irrigation for high-value crops across 5,039 ha of upland fields. These networks will provide on-farm drip irrigation and \u201cwater on demand\u201d for farmers. The project will transform agriculture production systems by integrating a disaster-resilient value chain from seedling and planting to harvesting and post-harvest handling. It will also enhance access to financial services and agriculture extension services, such as training for farmers. In upland CAD areas, the project will promote perennial crops with export potential, such as mango, papaya, guava, and passion fruit. In lowland paddy areas, it will support seasonal diversification into other crops, such as mung bean, chili, maize, groundnut, and other vegetables, particularly during the Yala cultivation season from April to September. The project will also assist farmer organisations in operating as business entities, adopting smart, market-driven production systems with tailored access to financial services, extension support, and marketing through public and private producer partnerships. Sri Lanka was hit by Cyclone Ditwah in late November, resulting in the country\u2019s worst flood in two decades and the deadliest natural hazard since the 2004 tsunami. The disaster damaged over 160,000 ha of paddy fields along with nearly 96,000 ha of other crops and 13,500 ha of vegetables.

The Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday approved the implementation of the loan schemes, and these initiatives consolidate previous concessionary programs, including SMILE-III for industrial investments, E-FRIEND-II for environmentally friendly financing, and the earlier RE-MSME scheme, under a unified framework to strengthen the entrepreneurship sector. The new schemes are expected to provide immediate and medium-term financial support to around 130,000 entrepreneurs across the country. Loans will be offered at a concessional interest rate of 3% per annum, with a maximum grace period of six months. \u201cAs per the program, MSMEs can access up to Rs. 250,000, while small and medium-scale enterprises (SME) can obtain loans of up to Rs. 1 million,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday. He said the RE-MSME Disaster Relief component specifically targets businesses disrupted by natural disasters, ensuring continuity and enabling rapid recovery. \u201cBy streamlining existing programs into a single, more efficient scheme, the Government aims to boost investment, production, and environmental sustainability within the MSME sector, contributing to broader economic resilience and growth,\u201d he added. The proposal to this effect was submitted by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in his capacity as the Finance, Planning and Economic Development Minister.

Although Sri Lanka remains locked out of international capital markets it continues to access and service loans from multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Sri Lanka settled $ 1.36 billion in external debt servicing in the first half of 2025, covering 55% of the $ 2.45 billion due for the full year, according to data from the Public Debt Management Office and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). This leaves $ 1.09 billion to be met in the second half of the year. CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe recently said that annual external debt servicing will average around $ 2.75 billion till 2027 under current commitments. From 2028 onwards, it is projected to rise, reaching between $ 3.2 billion and $ 3.5 billion, and peaking at close to $ 4 billion in certain years within the next decade, he said. According to the 3Q 2025 Debt Bulletin, multilateral lenders account for 37% of the external portfolio, followed by commercial debt at 34% and bilateral debt at 29%. ISBs continue to dominate commercial liabilities, representing roughly 81% of the category, with the balance comprised of syndicated foreign-currency term facilities. The ADB and the World Bank together make up more than 83% of multilateral exposures. Among bilateral creditors, 59% of outstanding loans are from non-Paris Club lenders, while 41% originate from Paris Club members. The bulletin records substantial progress in the external debt restructuring process since the country defaulted its debt in April 2022. On 26 June 2024, Sri Lanka concluded debt treatment agreements with the Official Creditor Committee and separately with the Export-Import Bank of China. Amendment arrangements were signed to operationalise both sets of agreements. The restructuring of loans from the China Development Bank was completed through amendment agreements on 24 December 2024. Commercial restructuring proceeded in parallel. An agreement in principle with ISB holders was reached on 19 September 2024, with the subsequent bond exchange finalised on 16 December 2024. Participation reached nearly 98%, enabling almost the entire stock of defaulted ISBs to be converted into new instruments. Progress with Paris Club creditors continued through 2025. Sri Lanka concluded bilateral amendatory agreements with Japan on 24 March 2025, with the Export-Import Bank of India on 25 March (Lines of Credit) and 3 April (Buyer\u2019s Credit Agreements), and with the Government of France on 16 June. Agreements with EXIM Bank of Hungary on 01 July and the United Kingdom on 22 August brought total completion of restructuring commitments to about 94% More recently, SriLankan Airlines reached an agreement in principles with external Bondholders holding $ 175 million worth of debt instruments. With these arrangements in place, the Government has resumed regular debt servicing to the respective creditor partners.

The financing agreement was signed on 3 December 2025 by Treasury Secretary Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma and World Bank Division Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, David N. Sislen, representing the Government of Sri Lanka and the IDA, respectively. A statement issued by the Finance Ministry External Resources Department noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s current grid capacity has become a major constraint in integrating additional renewable energy, posing significant technical challenges. The new project is designed to expand and modernise grid infrastructure to accommodate higher volumes of clean power in line with the national policy target of generating 70% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The initiative will also be supported by a proposed World Bank payment guarantee facility intended to scale up private sector investment in renewable energy projects. Through a range of financial instruments, the broader program aims to unlock private capital, strengthen institutional capacity, and ensure a stable and affordable power supply. The total project cost is estimated at $ 60 million. The World Bank will provide $ 30 million under the first phase, while the remaining $ 30 million is expected under a second phase of financing.

Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit last week, Unilever Sri Lanka Marketing Director Imeshika Kariyawasam said despite economic turbulence, Sri Lanka continues to be viewed positively within Unilever\u2019s global system. \u201cIn the global Unilever eyes, we are performing better in terms of the relative size and the right-to-win side of things,\u201d she added. She acknowledged that size matters, noting that Sri Lanka is just \u201c1.5 to 2% of India\u2019s population\u201d and \u201cabout 10% of Pakistan\u2019s population.\u201d However, she stressed that Unilever evaluates markets using several additional criteria beyond population alone. \u201cWhen you look at the other lenses that we look at\u2014the GDP per capita or the per-capita turnover\u2014that our portfolio generates, we perform better as a country. From the shared point of view, we have the right to transform, grow the categories that we are in,\u201d she added. Kariyawasam said Unilever assesses investments based on incremental growth potential and the speed at which capital can be recovered. \u201cThis is where the country\u2019s economic journey and the regulatory journey comes in; when you make an investment, how fast you can get that return on investment (RoI) into the business,\u201d she noted. Kariyawasam cited the company\u2019s long presence in the laundry segment as evidence of how category transformation can unlock significant value. \u201cFor the past 80 years, it was a bar format, and in the last decade, we transformed our consumer from bar format to powder. Now, when we move them from powder to liquid, we unlock approximately 15% value in a transaction,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s value generation that happens in the country even in the mass categories,\u201d she added She opined that while Sri Lanka\u2019s population is small, categories such as skincare and haircare remain \u201csignificantly underpenetrated,\u201d presenting substantial future opportunity, particularly given the country\u2019s high literacy and female literacy rates. \u201cWhen the right product comes in with the right proposition and the right benefit, it can unlock fast future growth,\u201d she said. Kariyawasam noted that the country\u2019s potential is not limited by scale. \u201cSri Lanka is very much poised to grow,\u201d she stressed, while cautioning that macroeconomic and regulatory stability remains essential. \u201cWe need the external environment stability to bring this full opportunity to life,\u201d she said.

The Government of Sri Lanka has signed a $ 150 million financial agreement with the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group to implement a comprehensive project. The project, which will run from 2024 to 2028, seeks to enhance prevention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), elderly and palliative care, and strengthen community-level health services, while also building resilience against climate-related emergencies. A key challenge identified in the project is the insufficient transport facilities available for field officers, including Public Health Midwives, public health inspectors, primary care nurses, and surveillance teams. \u201cTo address this, the Cabinet approved the procurement of a wide range of vehicles and equipment to improve mobility, support house-based care, and enhance the efficiency of field testing and supervisory work. The measures will also ensure the safe and timely transport of clinical waste and medical supplies across districts,\u201d Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said at the post-Cabinet meeting media briefing yesterday. The approved transport assets include 26 clinical waste transport lorries, 26 double cabs, five ten-seat vans, two 42-seat buses, and nearly 4,000 scooters and motorbikes for field officers, including Public Health Midwives, nurses, and inspectors. Additional provisions include 20 refrigerated trucks and eight forklifts for the Medical Supply Division, a crew cab for the Divisional Health Office in Puttalam, and a dedicated ambulance fleet for the Jaffna district. He noted that these measures are critical to expanding community outreach, ensuring timely delivery of services, and strengthening the country\u2019s health system to better respond to both ongoing public health needs and future emergencies. \u201cThe World Bank-backed initiative is expected to have a transformative impact on primary health care access and efficiency across all districts in the country,\u201d he added. The proposal to this effect was submitted by Health Minister Dr. Jayatissa.

The EDB has earlier organised a Sri Lanka Pavilion at Productronica in 2019 for the first time. Productronica 2025 Messe M\u00fcnchen is a World\u2019s leading Biennial Trade Fair with Innovative Solutions and products for the entire value chain in Electronics and Electrical Manufacturing. Productronica 2025 was a highly successful event, with over 1,600 exhibitors from 52 countries participated and demonstrated a robust and upbeat industry despite recent challenges. Key outcomes included a significant increase in exhibitors and international visitors, with over 47,000 attendees from nearly 100 countries. Productronica also celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2025. Sri Lankan participating companies as exhibitors included Excel Tech Ltd., Dynexis Ltd., ICONIC Devices Ltd., Mega Heaters Ltd., Micro Electric International Ltd., and Micro Power Engineering Ltd., representing the Electronic and Electrical Manufacturing sector. The Sri Lanka Pavilion\u2019s distinctive and inventive product line and appeal drew a lot of interest from international buyers and visitors generating numerous business inquiries and new market opportunities. The 2025 participation further strengthened Sri Lanka\u2019s Electronic and Electrical Manufacturing sector presence in the EU market and beyond, enhancing visibility for high-quality Sri Lankan products and reinforcing the island\u2019s image as a reliable sourcing destination for premium goods. The Minister Counsellor (Commercial) of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Berlin, Germany, welcomed and encouraged the Sri Lankan exhibitors at the pavilion. The Sri Lankan exhibitors at Productronica 2025 has also showcased their products and services at SEMICON Europa, the largest European Electronics platform connecting Industry Leaders across the entire Manufacturing Supply Chain from every segment and sector of the European microelectronics industries including Semiconductors, LEDs, MEMS, Printed/Organic/Flexible, and other adjacent markets.

The decision was approved on a 9\u20133 vote, with Governor Stephen Miran calling for a 50-basis point reduction and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee preferring no change. The policy statement repeated earlier guidance that future adjustments will depend on incoming data, the economic outlook and the balance of risks. Similar wording in December 2024 preceded a pause in rate cuts until September 2025. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the current rate level allows the committee to observe how the economy develops. He said no decision has been made on the January meeting. US equity markets rose after the announcement and Treasury yields moved lower. The Fed\u2019s updated projections indicated one rate cut in 2026 and one in 2027, with the policy rate expected to settle around 3% in the longer run. The projections showed divisions within the committee, with seven officials indicating no cuts next year and several nonvoting participants noting reservations about the decision. The committee raised its forecast for 2026 US GDP growth to 2.3% and continues to see inflation remaining above the 2% target until 2028. The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure was 2.8% in September. Powell has three meetings remaining before the end of his term.

Vimalenthirarajah. The event drew strong participation from across the local business community. The forum brought together a high-profile visiting Vietnamese delegation led by Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Phan Thi Thang, alongside Ambassador Trinh Thi Tam, comprising several high-profile representatives from Viet Nam\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as leading corporate entities in agricultural machinery, aquaculture, aviation, and pharmaceuticals. The delegation\u2019s arrival, coordinated in close partnership with the Embassy of Viet Nam in Sri Lanka, came at an especially important time. As the country works to rebuild economic momentum in the aftermath of Cyclone Ditwah, international trade delegations help reinforce confidence, renew investor interest, and signal clearly that Sri Lanka remains open for business. Ambassador Trinh Thi Tam has played a steady and constructive role in strengthening engagement, and the strong turnout at the forum reflected that sustained effort. Coffee emerged as an unexpected highlight of the discussions. While Viet Nam is known the world over for its coffee industry, the delegation noted that Sri Lanka\u2019s climate and soil conditions make it an ideal location for cultivation, and expressed interest in facilitating potential investment in coffee plantations in Sri Lanka from Vietnamese companies as well as sharing expertise. The delegation also expressed interest in opportunities across agriculture and aquaculture, logistics, textiles and garments, machinery, broader trade and investment, and early direct flights. The Ceylon Chamber said itis committed to carrying this progress forward and advancing deeper commercial engagement between the two countries.

He made these remarks recently during a panel discussion titled, \u2018Turning Data into Direction: Shaping Tourism Together\u2019 organised by Australia\u2019s Market Development Facility (MDF), in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) to launch Sri Lanka\u2019s 12- month national airport exit survey to support data-driven tourism planning in the country. Mudadeniya noted that nation branding is not a marketing campaign, but the reputation a country earns over decades through consistent policy, governance, public diplomacy, cultural exports, innovation, and overall national behaviour. \u201cA nation brand cannot be built through advertisements,\u201d he said, citing Incredible India as an example of a tourism campaign rather than a driver of India\u2019s global reputation. According to Mudadeniya, a country\u2019s brand strength reflected in global indices, directly affects tourism return on investment (RoI). He pointed out that Malaysia delivers significantly higher returns on tourism marketing spend because it enjoys a stronger national image. \u201cGood country brands are easier to market. Mediocre ones need more money,\u201d he said. He stressed that Sri Lanka must build a stronger national image through sustained policy consistency. Only then will tourism marketing become more effective. \u201cNation branding is earned, not bought,\u201d he reiterated, adding that it takes 10 to 15 years for a country to change its image through consistent policy. However, he said this a very strategic role which the Governments have now established and do it in a very bland manner through the policies of the country. \u201cFor example, \u2018Clean Sri Lanka\u2019, policy can be a great way to enter the nation branding process. Because when the nation brand is established, then the tourism people will find it easier to market it,\u201d he added. On tourism marketing and research, Mudadeniya said the current research initiative by the SLTDA and MDF is a solid start, but must evolve into a more rigorous, continuous process. He highlighted global best practices such as Australia\u2019s daily airport exit surveys, integration of forward-booking data, credit card spending details, STR hotel analytics, and data from Online Travel Agencies (OTA) platforms, to create an accurate, comprehensive tourism intelligence dashboard. He proposed merging datasets, institutionalising research at a national level and commercialising the outputs so that private-sector stakeholders can subscribe and utilise insights, strengthening industry-wide decision-making. Mudadeniya also underscored the need to differentiate market-driven strategy (responding to current demand) from marketing-driven strategy (creating new demand through innovation), noting that research alone cannot define the full scope of tourism development. On the impending global marketing campaign, he clarified that the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) is the custodian and implementer, while the Advisory Committee only provides guidance. He stressed that the campaign must be underpinned by a formal marketing strategy involving segmentation, targeting, market prioritisation, financial planning, RoI projections and clear performance measurement. He acknowledged bureaucratic hurdles, but said the industry and advisory bodies remain committed to supporting the campaign\u2019s implementation. \u201cEveryone has opinions about tourism, but decisions must be backed by data and grounded in operational realities,\u201d he noted. Mudadeniya called for deeper private-sector involvement through the SLTPB, saying stronger collaboration will ensure greater accountability, better strategy and a more competitive national tourism brand in the long term.

A special media briefing was held today at the Export Development Board (EDB), presided over by EDB Chairman Mangala Wijesinghe concurrent with the pre-fair workshop held to inform exporters participating in the exhibition. EDB officials, including Director of the Export Agriculture Division Janaka Badugama, and exporters participated in this occasion. Spanning an impressive 510 square meters at the Dubai Exhibition Centre in Expo City, the Sri Lanka Country Pavilion will feature 61 leading export companies showcasing a diverse range of products including coconut products, processed foods, spices, tea, and ready-to-eat items. Gulfood, recognised as one of the world\u2019s most important food and beverage sourcing events, has consistently demonstrated its value as a premier platform for networking, innovation, and business development. The 30th edition of Gulfood reportedly generated approximately $ 20 billion in trade deals over five days, attracting over 5,500 exhibitors from 129 countries and more than 144,000 visitors who explored over one million products. The 31st edition of Gulfood 2026 will be hosted across two venues \u2013 the Dubai World Trade Centre and the Dubai Exhibition Centre \u2013 making it the largest edition to date. Sri Lanka\u2019s participation in Gulfood 2026 represents a strategic initiative to expand the country\u2019s footprint in key international markets. In 2024, Sri Lankan agricultural commodities valued at $ 1,381 million were exported to the MEASA region (Middle East, Africa, and South Asia), with food and beverage products accounting for $ 1,171.31 million of this total. \u201cThis event presents a strategic opportunity to showcase Sri Lanka\u2019s premium food and beverage products to a broader audience across the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, as well as the EU and related markets. Our main objective is to increase exports to the MEASA region by $ 20-30 million by 2027,\u201d said EDB Chairman/Chief Executive Officer Managala Wijesinghe. The Gulfood platform offers Sri Lankan companies an excellent opportunity to network with major industry stakeholders, capture new market opportunities, promote Sri Lankan brands, develop high-quality business contacts, and strengthen relationships with existing buyers through interactive experiences and business matchmaking programs. The EDB\u2019s strategic focus on the Middle East region extends beyond Gulfood, encompassing participation in other key regional events including the Organic & Natural Expo Dubai, Beauty World Dubai, Middle East Rubber & Tyre Expo, and Foodex Saudi. With increasing global attention on the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region from countries including the EU, Japan, China, and Africa, Sri Lanka\u2019s strong presence at Gulfood 2026 positions the nation to capitalise on emerging trade opportunities and further strengthen its position as a reliable supplier of high-quality food and beverage products.

The banking debt restructuring arrangement and prospective capital infusions are subject to conditions, including a minimum investment of Rs. 682 million by existing major shareholders. The company said the agreed in-principle restructuring proposal includes concessional interest rates and a deferment of repayments. According to the amended section of the 2024/25 Annual Report, the revised terms provide for an interest rate of SOFR+1% for the first two years of the restructuring period, after which a mutually agreed reasonable interest rate will apply. The total repayment tenure is nine years, including a one-year grace period for principal repayment. These developments are described as non-adjusting subsequent events as they relate to conditions arising after the reporting date. Hela Apparel also said it is carrying out discussions with several strategic investors with a view to securing new equity investments in the group. The Board has provided in-principle approval to negotiate suitable terms of investment. The company noted that the capital infusion plan contemplates approximately Rs. 1 billion from existing shareholders in the second half of 2025/2026, alongside an investment between Rs. 3 billion and Rs. 4.4 billion from a prospective strategic investor. The company said these discussions are progressing positively. Once the terms of investment are agreed in principle with an investor, the company said it will provide the necessary market disclosures and seek shareholder approval as necessary, including through an extraordinary general meeting. The group reported a negative net asset value per share of Rs. 4.55 as of end-September 2025, compared with a positive Rs. 5.76 a year earlier.

Since re-launching its activities this year, WISL has hosted three successful networking events attended by more than 150 recent and prospective returnees representing the UK, US, Middle East, Europe, Singapore, and Australia. These gatherings have sparked meaningful dialogue between global talent and the local business community and have strengthened a unique network of senior professionals, founders, and policymakers committed to supporting Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cbrain gain\u201d efforts. The upcoming conference builds on this momentum by bringing both sides of this network, diaspora talent and Sri Lankan industry leadership, into one room to exchange insights, assess opportunities, and explore pathways for return, investment, and long-term contribution. The conference will feature two key panels and a Fireside Conversation. The Fireside Conversation, which will focus on the topic \u201cEconomic Outlook and Stability,\u201d will feature Chief Presidential Adviser on Digital Economy Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya, LYNEAR Wealth Management Chairman and former Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, and LYNEAR Wealth Management Managing Director and Co-Founder Dr. Naveen Gunawardane.

WISL Co-Founder Nayana Samaranayake said: \u201cMany Sri Lankans abroad are open to the idea of returning, investing, or contributing \u2014 but they often don\u2019t know where to start. What they need first is clarity, honest information, and a genuine connection to people on the ground who understand the realities. Our goal is to create a space where they can access insights without conditions, meet others who have made the journey home, and feel supported in making an informed and confident decision about Sri Lanka.\u201d The conference will be held on 17 December from 6 p.m. onwards at Cinnamon Life, Colombo.

That surge has pushed ChatGPT\u2019s total downloads to 1.36 billion since launch, a staggering achievement for an app that entered the mainstream less than three years ago, Gulf News reported. For years, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook dominated the world\u2019s app charts, setting the benchmark for global reach and engagement. That dominance has now been disrupted. In just two and a half years, ChatGPT has not only joined that elite group but taken the top spot as the most downloaded app on the planet. The app\u2019s rise highlights how quickly artificial intelligence has moved from a niche technology to a global phenomenon. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which brought generative AI into everyday use, has become the industry\u2019s flagship platform, driving the fast-growing AI ecosystem. Its growth trajectory now mirrors that of TikTok in its early years, an indicator of both lasting engagement and rapid adoption. The data also suggests users are not just experimenting with AI tools but actively integrating them into their digital routines. TikTok remains the second-most-downloaded app this year, with 703 million installs, while Instagram follows with 521.6 million. Facebook, WhatsApp, and Temu round out the top five with 404 to 444 million downloads each. Google\u2019s Gemini app is the only other AI entrant in the top ten, securing 392 million installs. By November 2025, ChatGPT held an 81.8% share of the global AI chatbot market, more than four times that of its top five rivals combined, according to previous TechGaged research. Despite emerging players like DeepSeek and Perplexity intensifying competition, ChatGPT\u2019s market leadership remains firm. That grip will likely continue into next year as user engagement deepens and AI integration extends across industries.

A discussion meeting was held recently at the EDB premises, with the participation of Secretary to the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Tilaka Jayasundara, EDB Chairman and CEO Mangala Wijesinghe, Acting Director General Erandika Dissanayake, Acting Additional Director General Kumudinie Mudalige, Trade Facilitation and Trade Information Director Dr. Sanjeewa Rathnasekara along with senior officials and exporters. The EDB has already commenced comprehensive damage assessments of exporters most affected by the adverse weather conditions. These assessments will guide the targeted relief interventions required for the export sector. EDB Chairman emphasised that strategic interventions are actively underway to tackle immediate challenges facing the export sector. These measures focus on minimising disruptions to export operations to ensure a steady flow of goods and services to international markets. Additionally, efforts are being made to mitigate the adverse impact on production capacity, safeguarding the ability of exporters to maintain output levels. A key priority is also placed on reactivating disrupted supply chains, restoring the seamless connectivity essential for efficient production and export processes. Through these targeted actions, the EDB aims to sustain export growth and build resilience against short-term obstacles. The EDB is currently working closely with customs, port authorities, and logistics providers to manage infrastructure delays caused by adverse weather conditions and expedite export-related clearances. Special Government attention has now been focused on assisting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in particular to rapidly reactivate their operational capacity during this recovery process. The discussion highlighted the growing intensity and frequency of climate-related challenges in recent times, underscoring the urgent need for proactive and sustainable responses. It was emphasised that addressing these environmental issues is not only critical for mitigating risks but also essential for ensuring long-term economic resilience. By integrating sustainability into export practices and promoting green technologies, the EDB aims to strengthen the export sector\u2019s competitiveness and sustainability. This approach seeks to support exporters in adapting to climate realities while fostering greener and more resilient trade pathways that align with global environmental goals.

Pathfinder Foundation Chairman Bernard Goonetilleke, in his opening remarks stressed the importance of sound fiscal governance in the wake of the socio-political crises experienced in Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh in recent years\u2014which indicate that South Asia can no longer treat fiscal policy as secondary or routine. His remarks concluded on the note that the discussion was of vital importance in the wake of the catastrophic cyclone that ravaged Sri Lanka the previous week. Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) Asia and Pacific Department Director Anoop Singh, delivered the keynote address, emphasising that the global economy is heading into a new era characterised by significant changes in the international trading environment, where the role of public finance and its management as catalysts for economic growth has been highlighted. This shift, however, could not be timelier, given the historic highs global debt has reached. \u201cWhat you cannot see, you cannot manage,\u201d Singh said that one of the main drivers of increasing global debt is \u201cdata gaps\u201d caused by inconsistently defined, misclassified, and unreported debt and expenditure, among other issues. Additionally, Singh asserted that these data gaps are deliberate and that a framework for global financial reporting of this calibre must be established by developing systems that monitor and audit, supported by institutions that uphold these systems. Pathfinder Foundation Distinguished Fellow and Former Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga and Pathfinder Foundation Distinguished Fellow Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy also share their insights. The concluding remarks were given by Pathfinder Foundation Executive Director Dr. Dayaratna Silva who expressed his sincere gratitude to Anoop Sing for his excellent presentation. He also mentioned the support that Singh has consistently provided to Sri Lanka when landmark economic reforms were carried out in 1977. He appreciated the contributions of key resource persons, who clarified complex issues in public finance with remarkable clarity and insight. The Pathfinder Foundation continues to facilitate dialogue between related field experts, aiming to direct Sri Lanka towards a sustainable and prosperous future.

Behind the wheel of each tuk-tuk is a dedicated driver\u2014someone who works tirelessly to support their family, often under challenging financial circumstances. As the nation continues to navigate economic difficulties, these drivers are under increasing pressure. Yet, their resilience and commitment remain unwavering. Beyond their role in transportation, three-wheeler drivers often serve as first responders in emergencies\u2014rushing the injured to hospitals, helping stranded motorists, or offering rides late at night when no other options are available. Their contribution to society is significant, though frequently overlooked. In recognition of these everyday heroes, Orient Finance PLC has launched a heartfelt campaign that brings to life the real story of a three-wheeler driver. The campaign follows a day in his life, shedding light on the hard work, perseverance, and sense of responsibility that defines their profession. It aims to raise awareness of the struggles they endure while celebrating the vital role they play within their communities. This initiative is more than just a commercial\u2014it is a tribute to the three-wheeler community. Through this campaign, Orient Finance reaffirms its commitment to supporting these drivers, not only through words but with meaningful financial solutions designed specifically for their needs. Speaking about the campaign, K.M.M. Jabir, Executive Director and CEO of Orient Finance PLC, said, \u201cThese individuals are the backbone of our local transport network. They operate under trying conditions to deliver an essential service that many rely on\u2014whether for commuting, emergencies, or day-to-day mobility. At Orient Finance, we deeply value their contribution. Our role extends beyond financial services; we are here to uplift their lives. The First Month\u2019s Rental Waiver is just one of many steps we are taking to offer real, impactful support.\u201d At the heart of this initiative is the Orient Tuk Leasing plan, carefully crafted to meet the unique financial challenges faced by three-wheeler drivers. The plan offers a one-month grace period before the first rental payment, providing much-needed breathing space to manage household expenses, vehicle repairs, and maintenance. With low monthly installments and the option to borrow a higher amount, it helps ease the strain of ongoing costs. In addition, the approval process is quick and straightforward, ensuring drivers receive timely support without unnecessary delays. The plan also includes a Life Insurance Scheme, which provides Rs. 500,000 in support to a driver\u2019s family in the event of an untimely death. Already, more than ten families have benefitted from this safety net, reflecting the tangible impact of the initiative. For those seeking Sharia-compliant financial solutions, Orient Finance also offers Ijarah Tuk Leasing, reinforcing its commitment to inclusive and accessible services for all communities. Recognising that many drivers invest their life savings into down payments\u2014often leaving little to cover immediate needs\u2014Orient Finance\u2019s approach provides both short-term relief and long-term financial stability. The company\u2019s goal is to empower drivers to focus on what truly matters: their livelihoods, their loved ones, and their future. With this campaign and the enhanced leasing offering, Orient Finance PLC continues to stand with Sri Lanka\u2019s three-wheeler drivers\u2014not just as a financial institution, but as a true partner that listens, understands, and acts.

Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thero, recently handed over a report to the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA). In this report, they emphasize that Sri Lanka, endowed with plentiful sunlight, biomass, wind, and hydro resources, possesses significant potential for generating renewable power. The country\u2019s geographic location provides a unique opportunity to harness these natural resources for energy. However, the renewable energy sector faces significant challenges, including a lack of new technologies, insufficient establishment of new projects, and unstable finances. These issues are compounded by the nation\u2019s recent and ongoing electrical power outages, which have further strained the economy. To address these challenges and foster investment in new renewable energy projects, relevant authorities must develop constructive strategies, sound plans, new laws and regulations, and unique incentives. These measures will encourage consumers to transition to renewable energy and stimulate growth in the sector. In this report, they also point out that, despite the clear benefits, certain groups with vested interests have sought to obstruct and delay renewable energy projects, citing various justifications. The National Environmental Caucus stands firmly in support of promoting and advancing renewable energy initiatives. They are also committed to encouraging and supporting local investments, recognising the importance of foreign direct investments, especially in light of Sri Lanka\u2019s current financial crisis. A case in point is the proposed 500 MW wind project between Mannar and Pooneryn. This project has encountered opposition from several parties for a variety of reasons. The National Environmental Caucus organization believes that this project should move forward, provided that all necessary precautions are taken to mitigate its environmental impact.

The plan is focused on a broad-based product offensive, increased electrification, new approaches to engineering and manufacturing, the adoption of new technologies, and the use of strategic partnerships to increase global unit sales and improve profitability. The plan is positioned as a bridge between the Nissan NEXT business transformation plan running from fiscal* 2020 through fiscal 2023 and Nissan Ambition 2030, the company\u2019s long-term vision. The new plan is split into mid- term imperatives for fiscal years 2024 through 2026, and mid-long-term actions to be carried out through 2030. Nissan President and Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida said: \u201cThe Arc plan shows our path to the future. It illustrates our continuous progression and ability to navigate changing market conditions. This plan will enable us to go further and faster in driving value and competitiveness. Faced with extreme market volatility, Nissan is taking decisive actions guided by the new plan to ensure sustainable growth and profitability.\u201d Under the two-part plan, Nissan will first take actions to ensure volume growth through a tailored regional strategy and prepare for an accelerated transition to EVs, supported by a balanced electrified/ICE product portfolio, volume growth in major markets and financial discipline. Through these initiatives Nissan aims to lift annual sales by 1 million units and increase its operating profit margin to more than 6%, both by the end of fiscal year 2026. This will pave the way for the second part of the plan aimed to enable the EV transition and realize long- term profitable growth, supported by smart partnerships, enhanced EV competitiveness, differentiated innovations and new revenue streams. By fiscal year 2030, Nissan sees a revenue potential of 2.5 trillion yen from new business opportunities. Nissan plans to launch 30 new models over the next three years, of which 16 will be electrified, and 14 will be ICE models, to meet the diversified customer needs in markets where the pace of electrification differs. Nissan plans to launch a total of 34 electrified models from fiscal year 2024 and 2030 to cover all segments, with the model mix of electrified vehicles expected to account for 40% globally by fiscal year 2026 and rise to 60% by the end of the decade. In key regions and markets, Nissan\u2019s actions by fiscal year 2026 (unless otherwise indicated) include: The product offensive will be supported by new development and manufacturing approaches aimed to make EVs more affordable and increase profitability. By developing EVs in families, integrating powertrains, utilizing next-generation modular manufacturing, group sourcing, and battery innovations, Nissan aims to reduce the cost of next-generation EVs by 30% (when compared to the current model Ariya crossover) and achieve cost-parity between EVs and ICE models by fiscal year 2030. In the area of family development alone, the cost of subsequent vehicles \u2013 those developed based on the main vehicle in the family \u2013 can be reduced by 50%, the variation of trim parts reduced by 70% and development lead time shortened by four months. By adopting modular manufacturing, the vehicle production line will be shortened, reducing the production time per vehicle by 20%. Under the Arc plan, more plants in Japan and overseas will adopt the Nissan Intelligent Factory concept, with the Oppama and Nissan Motor Kyushu plants in Japan, the Sunderland Plant in the UK and Canton and Smyrna plants in the U.S. starting the adoption from fiscal year 2026 through 2030. Meanwhile the EV36Zero production approach will be extended from Sunderland in the UK to plants including Canton, Decherd and Smyrna in the U.S., and Tochigi and Kyushu in Japan from fiscal year 2025 through 2028. The plan includes proposals to accelerate the evolution of vehicle intelligence technologies such as next-generation ProPILOT driver-assistance system, which realize door-to-door autonomous driving technology from on-highway to off- highway, private premises, and parking. Nissan will offer enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all solid-state batteries to provide diversified EVs to meet different customer needs. Nissan will significantly enhance NCM li-ion batteries, reducing quick-charging time by 50% and increasing energy density by 50% compared to the Ariya. LFP batteries, to be developed and produced in Japan, will be launched that will reduce cost by 30% compared to the Sakura EV minivehicle. New EVs with enhanced NCM li-ion, LFP and all-solid-state batteries will be launched in fiscal year 2028. Nissan will harness strategic partnerships to stay competitive and offer a global portfolio of products and technology. Nissan will continue to leverage the alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors in Europe, LATAM, ASEAN and India. In China, Nissan will fully utilize its local assets to meet the needs of China and beyond; and explore new partnerships in Japan and the U.S. Batteries will be developed and sourced with partners to bring 135 gigawatt hours of global capacity. Underpinning the plan is firm financial discipline, enabling stable CAPEX and R&D investment ratio versus net revenue of between 7% to 8% excluding battery capacity investment. Additionally, Nissan plans to invest more than 400 billion yen in battery capacity. Meanwhile, investment in electrification will increase progressively, becoming more than 70% by fiscal year 2026. Managing these investments is aimed to allow delivering benefits to all stakeholders, with Nissan maintaining positive free cash flow before M&A \u2013 even after electrification investments. This is to secure total shareholder return at more than 30%. Nissan aims to maintain net cash at a healthy level of 1 trillion yen throughout the Arc plan period. \u201cUnder this comprehensive plan we will enhance Nissan\u2019s competitiveness and achieve sustainable profitability,\u201d added Uchida. \u201cNissan is confident that it has what it takes to properly execute this plan, which will provide us with the firm foundation we need to bridge to our Nissan Ambition 2030 vision.\u201d", "content_hash": "f7bc2e298d06e2c92a93c26a19f2a1b1", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:46:57.127072", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:46:57.127081", "update_count": 0}, "170": {"source": "EconomicTimes.lk", "section": "economy", "title": "BSides Sri Lanka 2025 Celebrates a Breakthrough Cybersecurity Gathering in Colombo", "url": "https://economictimes.lk/index.php/2025/06/03/bsides-sri-lanka-2025-celebrates-a-breakthrough-cybersecurity-gathering-in-colombo/", "text": "Over 280 individuals \u2014 from red teamers and DevSecOps specialists to corporate executives, researchers, policymakers, and students \u2014 came together for a landmark moment in Sri Lanka\u2019s cybersecurity journey: the inaugural BSides Sri Lanka conference. As the country\u2019s first chapter of the global Security BSides movement, this wasn\u2019t just another tech event. It was a declaration \u2014 that Sri Lanka\u2019s cybersecurity ecosystem is ready to step onto the world stage, powered not by top-down mandates, but by community-driven innovation, collaboration, and a hunger to learn. Breaking Down Silos: A Day of Insight, Innovation, and Hands-On Learning The BSides format is famously non-commercial, open, and technical \u2014 and the Sri Lankan edition stayed true to that ethos. The one-day conference delivered a carefully curated agenda that tackled the most pressing cybersecurity concerns of our time. From red teaming in cloud environments and secure SDLC strategies , to cyber hygiene awareness and the application of machine learning for threat detection , the sessions were deep, practical, and thought-provoking. But it wasn\u2019t just theory. The Hacking Village emerged as the event\u2019s most interactive draw\u2014 where attendees got their hands on physical security devices, learned how RFID badges could be cloned, and experienced in real time how vulnerabilities manifest in the wild. For many students and professionals, it was a rare chance to bridge the gap between classroom learning and frontline experience. More Than a Conference \u2014 A Crossroads for CyberCulture in Sri Lanka What stood out most wasn\u2019t just the quality of the content \u2014 it was the diversity of the audience. Attendees included penetration testers and SOC analysts, legal advisors and compliance officers, university students and academic researchers, not to mention policy thinkers and tech media. BSides Sri Lanka achieved something rare: it created a space where industry, academia, and government didn\u2019t just coexist \u2014 they converged . As one organizer put it: \u201cThe energy and curiosity we saw from students, professionals, and first-time attendees proves that the Sri Lankan cybersecurity community is not only growing \u2014 it\u2019s thriving. BSides Sri Lanka has now joined the global Security BSides family with a strong message: local innovation, global impact. This is just the beginning.\u201d Backed by Industry, Driven by Community A key reason for the event\u2019s success was its ability to attract support from key players in the tech ecosystem, without compromising its grassroots integrity. The event was powered by a collective effort: These partnerships are more than logos on a banner \u2014 they symbolize a growing alignment between corporate innovation and community-led knowledge sharing , both essential to building long-term cyber resilience in the region. Why BSides Sri Lanka Matters In a world where cyber threats evolve faster than most organizations can adapt, countries like Sri Lanka face a critical challenge: how to grow a cybersecurity culture that\u2019s both technically competent and deeply collaborative. BSides Sri Lanka 2025 showed us one path forward \u2014 a decentralized, inclusive, and hands-on approach to cybersecurity education and awareness.

The Bank\u2019s Development Credit Department, together with its Kaduruwela Branch, recently hosted the inaugural awareness programme titled \u201cEnhancing Paddy Productivity and Farmer Livelihoods through Adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and High-Tech Agriculture in the Polonnaruwa District.\u201d Held at the Agbo Hotel, Giritale, the event brought together more than 120 farmers from eight divisional areas, representing the district\u2019s diverse agricultural communities. This initiative is part of Commercial Bank\u2019s broader vision to drive national food security , empower the rural economy , and support farmers through knowledge-sharing and sustainable agricultural solutions that foster long-term economic resilience. This initiative was designed to address the persistent productivity gap in local paddy cultivation. While Polonnaruwa\u2019s average yield currently stands at around 4.5 metric tonnes per hectare, agricultural experts estimate the potential yield at approximately six metric tonnes. To help bridge this gap, the programme focused on creating awareness about modern cultivation methods, responsible use of agro-chemicals, mechanisation, financial management, and environmental sustainability. Among those who addressed the gathering were representatives of the Bank, the Department of Agriculture, the Eastern University, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka \u2013 North Central Region, A. Baur & Co. and Browns Agriculture. The sessions covered key topics such as the adoption of GAP principles, high-tech agricultural techniques, sustainable use of agro-inputs, and new technologies in paddy machinery. The Bank said the initiative aims to position Polonnaruwa as a model district for sustainable, GAP-based paddy cultivation. It also seeks to promote financial inclusion among rural communities by connecting farmers with formal banking channels and customised financial solutions to fund mechanisation, crop diversification, and value-added processing. Speaking about the programme, Mrs Mithila Shamini, Assistant General Manager \u2013 Personal Banking/SME at Commercial Bank said: \u201cAgriculture is the backbone of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, and its transformation is central to our nation\u2019s food security and rural prosperity. At Commercial Bank, we believe that empowering farmers through knowledge, technology, and financial inclusion is key to unlocking this transformation.

The symposium, organised by the Economic Research Department of the CBSL, comprised the following three research events that reflected the CBSL\u2019s commitment to enhancing economic research and evidence-based policymaking: Under this Research Symposium, the CBSL held its flagship research event, the 14th IRC, on 8 December 2025. The Conference aimed at stimulating innovative theoretical and empirical research on various contemporary macroeconomic policy issues. Delivering the inaugural address at this event, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Governor of the CBSL, highlighted the multidimensional risks faced by small open economies, including geoeconomic fragmentation, rapidly evolving trade and financial patterns, and climate risks that amplify economic vulnerabilities. In this context, the Governor stressed the importance of research-driven policymaking.2 Dr. Michael D. Patra, Former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, delivered the keynote address at the IRC. In his speech, titled \u2018Emerging Economies: Securing Stability Amidst Uncertain Times\u2019, Dr. Patra discussed the global trends, such as geopolitical uncertainties, economic and trade policy uncertainties, supply chain pressures, and financial market spillovers that threaten the economic stability of countries. He also underscored the need for emerging economies to forge pathways to hedge against these significant uncertainties by improving policy frameworks, identifying drivers of productivity and growth, strengthening economic buffers, pursuing climate harmony, and leveraging emerging technologies to safeguard long-term resilience. The inaugural session of the IRC was followed by two technical sessions chaired by Mrs. Nelumani Daulagala, Senior Deputy Governor and Dr. Chandranath Amarasekara, Deputy Governor of the CBSL. Eight research papers in the areas of inflation forecasting, capital flows, credit dynamics, financial risks, sustainable development, financial inclusion and productivity, which were selected through a rigorous double-blind evaluation process from a large number of submissions, were presented by the local and international researchers. Alongside the Conference, the CBSL published the latest volume of its flagship research journal, Staff Studies.\u00b3 On the second day of the Symposium, the CBSL hosted the SF Database Seminar. Sri Lanka held the Chairmanship of the SAARCFINANCE Network in 2024. It is customary for the country that held the SAARCFINANCE Chairmanship in a particular year to host the Database Seminar in the subsequent year. Accordingly, the CBSL hosted the SF Database Seminar in 2025, with delegates from SAARC central banks participating both in person and virtually. Delivering the keynote address during the inaugural session of the Seminar, Dr. Chandranath Amarasekara highlighted the importance of data and its effective use in achieving macroeconomic policy goals. He also pointed out that SAARCFINANCE Database can serve as a vital anchor in supporting the data-driven processes of the SAARC central banks, thereby strengthening regional stability. The Seminar featured two technical sessions chaired by Dr. (Mrs.) Sujeetha Jegajeevan, Director of Economic Research, and Dr. Vipula Wickramarachchi, Additional Director of Economic Research of the CBSL. Seven insightful country papers were presented by representatives from Bangladesh Bank, Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan, Reserve Bank of India, Maldives Monetary Authority, Nepal Rastra Bank, State Bank of Pakistan, and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. These papers offered policy experiences and practical insights on addressing macroeconomic instabilities caused by external and domestic headwinds across the region as well as the use of novel techniques for policy making. SAARCFINANCE Nodal Officers\u2019 Meeting was conducted on the sidelines of the Database Seminar. Recent developments and roadmap for the forthcoming year in relation to the database were discussed at this meeting. The final event under the Symposium was the 6th CBSL-ADB-APAEA Joint Workshop held on 10th December 2025. Inaugurating the CBSL-ADB-APAEA Conference, Dr Nandalal Weerasinghe, Governor of the CBSL emphasised that the central banks must upgrade their analytical capabilities continuously and adopt evidence-based policymaking amid rapid global economic changes and technological advancements. He also emphasised the importance of establishing a collaborative research network among the policy practitioners and academia. Further, Prof. Paresh Narayan, the Founder and President, APAEA and Dr. John Beirne, Principal Economist of the ADB also underscored the importance of sustaining research collaboration between institutions and the critical role of research in informed policy making.

This figure was 29% in Q4 2023 , and Coveware\u2019s stats show that diminishing payments have remained steady since early 2019. This decrease is due to organizations implementing more advanced protective measures, mounting legal pressure not to meet the crooks\u2019 financial demands, and cybercriminals repeatedly breaching promises not to publish or resale stolen data if a ransom is paid. However, it is essential to note that despite the drop in the payment rate, the amount paid to ransomware actors is higher than ever before, reaching $1.1 billion last year , according to a Chainalysis report. This is due to ransomware gangs hitting more organizations by escalating their attack frequency and demanding more substantial figures for not exposing stolen secrets and providing victims with a decryption key. Concerning Q1 2024, Coveware reports a 32% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) drop in the average ransom payment, now at $381,980, and a 25% QoQ increase in the median ransom payment, which stands at $250,000. This simultaneous drop in average and rise in median ransom payments indicates a decrease in high-figure payments and an increase in moderate amounts. This could be caused by ransom demands becoming more modest and/or fewer high-value targets succumbing to extortion. Regarding initial infiltration methods, there\u2019s a\u00a0rising number of cases where this is unknown, reaching nearly half of all reported cases in the first quarter of 2024. From those that have been determined, remote access and vulnerability exploitation play the largest role, with the CVE-2023-20269, CVE-2023-4966, and CVE-2024-1708-9 flaws being the more widely exploited in Q1 by ransomware operators. Coveware reports that the FBI\u2019s LockBit disruption has had a massive impact on the once-leading operation, as reflected in their attack statistics. The operation also brought turbulence to other major gangs, leading to payment disputes and exit scams , such as we saw with BlackCat/ALPHV. Moreover, these law enforcement operations have weakened the confidence of other ransomware affiliates toward RaaS operators, with many deciding to operate independently. \u201cWe have already seen an increase in Babuk forks in recent attacks, and several former RaaS affiliates using the ubiquitous, and almost free, Dharma / Phobos services,\u201d explains Coveware in the report . According to the security firm, affiliates, in many cases, decided to quit cybercrime altogether. \u201cMost participants in the cyber extortion ecosystems are not hardened criminals, rather they are individuals with STEM skills that live in jurisdictions lacking both extradition treaties, and sufficient legitimate economic opportunities to put their skills to use,\u201d continued\u00a0Coveware. \u201cSome of these people will view the increased risk of getting in trouble along with the risk of getting cut out of their income as enough reason to quit.\u201d In this volatile space, Akira tops the list with the most active ransomware in terms of attacks launched in the first quarter of the year, remaining in place #1 for nine months now. The FBI reported this week\u00a0that Akira is responsible for breaches in at least 250 organizations, pocketing $42 million in ransom payments.", "content_hash": "ae863826255a61318bd0e725771a9982", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:47:59.732824", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:47:59.732839", "update_count": 0}, "197": {"source": "EconomicTimes.lk", "section": "economy", "title": "U.S and Sri Lankan Navies to Conduct Upcoming CARAT Sri Lanka 2024 Exercise in Trincomalee", "url": "https://economictimes.lk/index.php/2024/04/22/u-s-and-sri-lankan-navies-to-conduct-upcoming-carat-sri-lanka-2024-exercise-in-trincomalee/", "text": "From April 22-26 in Trincomalee, the United States Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and Sri Lanka Navy\u00a0will partner for the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training\u00a0(CARAT) Sri Lanka 2024 exercise.\u00a0CARAT Sri Lanka will feature the expertise of the U.S. Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST), a\u00a0U.S. Marine Corps unit specialized in security and anti-terrorism for naval assets,\u00a0engaging alongside their Sri Lanka Navy Marine counterparts\u00a0on a full spectrum of naval capabilities.

The EFF arrangement was approved by the IMF Executive Board for a total amount of SDR 2.3 billion (about US$3 billion) on March 20, 2023.

Public finances have strengthened following substantial fiscal reforms. Program performance was strong, with all quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-December 2023 met except for the indicative target on social spending.

The Chamber acknowledges the concerns raised by the Sri Lanka Banks Association (SLBA) regarding the suspension\u2019s effect on loan recovery. This, in turn, could lead to higher borrowing costs due to the increase in risk premiums arising from delays in releasing collateral and the reluctance of the banking sector to lend to genuine, non-defaulting businesses due to the perceived challenges of foreclosure-related to tangible security. A robust debt recovery framework is essential for maintaining financial stability and facilitating economic activity. The Chamber recognizes the critical role of Sri Lanka\u2019s MSME / SME sectors, startups, and entrepreneurs. These businesses are driving the economy in terms of job creation, innovation, and diversification. The temporary suspension can provide them with some breathing room for operations. However, it is crucial to find an amicable solution that is supported by data to ensure this temporary relief doesn\u2019t lead to continued defaults.

However, while the central bank hopes to start exploring a CBDC, the CB is yet to officially declare a timeline on this. On January 10, Central Bank Governor, Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, presented an annual roadmap for policies for 2024 and beyond. However, no mention of a central bank digital currency was made. On the same day, two central bank executives presented to the Parliamentary Committee on Ways and Means. The talks included basic details about blockchain, cryptocurrency and CBDC. At one point, the leader of the Committee interrupted the CBDC talk, asking whether there was a timeline for a CBDC in Sri Lanka or an action plan. The central bank representative responded that the first step is to propose a proof of concept to the central bank board before proceeding to a pilot. The aim is to see if a CBDC meets the central bank\u2019s requirements. The central bank was advised to defer the CBDC work but expects to do it soon. Hence, it\u2019s likely to have been a miscommunication. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently visited the country, and it\u2019s unclear whether the advice to defer the CBDC project came from the IMF. Sri Lanka is emerging from a severe financial crisis that led to extreme shortages of necessities and violent protests in 2022. The President stepped down and fled the country for six weeks. A $4 billion lifeline from India prevented a more severe fallout. Some other points from the Committee meeting could impact the potential rollout of a future CBDC. For example, there was some discussion about deploying QR codes for payments on public transport. A person exploring QR code implementation stated that feature phones are still widely used in Sri Lanka. Plus, a large proportion of smartphones are very basic ones.

The fiscal deficit is set to be wider than our current forecast of 7.1% of GDP in 2024 in light of the new data, even after excluding bank recapitalization costs, and the revenue/GDP ratio would be lower than Fitch had assumed earlier. The government is targeting a budget deficit of 9.1% of GDP in 2024, wider than a revised estimate of 8.5% in 2023. However, without bank recapitalization costs, the deficit in 2024 would be a narrower 7.6% of GDP. Excluding recapitalization costs, the budget targets a primary surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 2024, against a deficit of 0.7% in 2023. However, including recapitalization costs pushes the 2024 primary deficit target to 0.6% of GDP. The primary surplus goal for 2024, excluding bank recapitalization, is broadly in line with the 0.8% of GDP projected by the IMF in March when it approved Sri Lanka\u2019s USD3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Fitch also see the revenue target as relatively aligned. However, the government\u2019s expenditure target for 2024, at 22.2% of GDP, is somewhat higher than the 19.7% the IMF had envisioned and well above the revised budget estimate of 18.7% for 2023. The release of the next tranche of EFF financing, worth around USD330 million, will depend partly on the IMF\u2019s assessment of Sri Lanka\u2019s progress in securing financing assurances from official creditors. Fitch believes there has been some progress since March, but the timeline for a restructuring deal with official creditors remains unclear.  Fitch believes there are significant risks to the government\u2019s revenue goal for 2024. Sri Lanka has a record of fiscal slippage, and revenue collection fell 29% short of target over 9M23. The authorities aim to raise revenue by almost 45% in 2024. This will be aided by a planned 3pp increase in the value-added tax to 18%, but the boost to revenue from inflation is set to weaken in 2024. The Rating agency project consumer prices will rise by 8.7% on average in 2024, compared with 22.1% in 2023. The lift from economic growth, which Fitch projects at 3.3% in 2024, will also be modest. Downside risks to revenue could be offset by lower-than-budgeted spending. We think the presidential election in late 2024 will incentivise the government to keep to its spending plans, which include a 14% increase in spending on salaries and wages. Nevertheless, if revenue falls short, there may be some room to trim capital expenditure, which amounts to almost 20% of total planned spending and is budgeted to rise 55% in 2024, excluding bank recapitalisation. The government\u2019s efforts to implement governance reform after a recent diagnostic study by the IMF may also support revenue collection. The budget proposes to establish a new revenue authority under the Ministry of Finance to improve tax collection, and a new investment law will look to establish a National Economic Commission to promote investment. However, it will take time to assess these bodies\u2019 effectiveness.  .", "content_hash": "e89ca23c00f44763a6277092d4bd68b4", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:48:33.682088", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:48:33.682098", "update_count": 0}, "213": {"source": "EconomicTimes.lk", "section": "economy", "title": "Corporate Earnings Nosedives to a 3-Year Low, but the banking sector posted a remarkable growth", "url": "https://economictimes.lk/index.php/2023/09/11/corporate-earnings-nosedives-to-a-3-year-low-but-the-banking-sector-posted-a-remarkable-growth/", "text": "Corporate earnings have reported consecutive YoY degrowth, in this June quarter with macroeconomic challenges pushing earnings to a 3-year low while the banking sector demonstrated remarkable growth.

Subsequent to the main ceremony, a revered statue of Lady Madhu was respectfully carried in procession throughout the church grounds to pay homage to the devoted attendees. A significant number of devotees from various parts of the island gathered for the annual feast. The year 2024 marks the completion of 100 years since the enshrinement of the revered statue of Lady Madhu. The church management board has decided to hold services throughout the year to commemorate this occasion. Rev. Dr. Brian Udaigwe, The Vatican Apostolic Nuncio of Sri Lanka, who attended the main service, commended President Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s statement in Parliament regarding National Peace and Reconciliation. He mentioned that this statement has received the blessings of the Vatican and the Catholic Church. Rev. Dr. Brian Udaigwe emphasized that religious leaders have a crucial role in maintaining peace and harmony in the country. He also stressed that whether a religious figure divides or unites the country is determined by their own actions.

Inflation has dropped sharply in recent months from the 69% hit last September, partly due to the statistical base effect, but also due to a stronger currency and better harvests. A severe foreign exchange crunch triggered Sri Lanka\u2019s worst financial crisis in seven decades last year, triggering the inflation surge. But figures released Monday showed its key inflation rate nearly halved to 6.3% from 12% in June. Economic stability has improved since March after a $2.9 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, the country needs to focus on reducing losses at state enterprises and to pass on energy prices as per IMF conditions which may boost inflation, analysts warned. \u201cThe high base effect issue will finish off in the next two months and beyond that we might actually see a slight upward push in inflation with the currency depreciation and possibly a bit of food inflation coming into play,\u201d said Dimantha Mathew, head of research at First Capital. \u201cThere could be some volatility in the last quarter and inflation could end the year at the 6%-8% range.\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s currency has appreciated about 10% this year but analysts are concerned it could come under pressure from stronger import demand in the last quarter. A government decision to raise water tariffs by as much as 50%, higher global commodity prices and severe dry weather in some rice growing regions will also pressure prices, several analysts said. Higher global cooking gas costs could also have an impact, Muditha Peiris, head of the state-run LPG company said on Friday, but ruled out immediate price hikes. The country\u2019s central bank remains confident in the downward trend. It expects the rate to fall within the 4%-6% target band and even dip below it in the next two months. \u201cBut in the medium term we expect inflation will stabilise within the target range of 4%-6%,\u201d P.K.G.

It was further discussed that due to this, injustice is being done to gem businessmen who run their business fairly by paying taxes to the government. This matter was taken into discussion at the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources & Sustainable Development as it met to discuss issues related to import, export and re-export in Gems and Jewellery sector recently in Parliament under the Chairmanship of  Ajith Mannapperuma. Representatives of business associations engaged in the Gems and Jewellery sector, officials including the Chairman of the Gems and Jewellery Authority, officials from the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization & National Policies, officials from the Sri Lanka Customs and the President\u2019s Senior Additional Secretary (Agriculture and Environment) were called before this Committee. Hon. Ajith Mannapperuma, Chair of the Committee, pointed out that the main expectation of these discussions is to work to restore the prestigious name of Sri Lankan gems among foreign countries and to get foreign exchange from the export and re-export of gems. Officials representing the Ministry of Finance pointed out that an amended Bill has already been submitted to Parliament to exempt the process from the 2.5% social security tax imposed on the importation of gems for re-export, and the relief is to be given to businessmen in the future. It was also revealed that even if you have to pay a tax of 2.5% while importing gems for re-export by courier, you can bring a lot of precious gems as hand luggage by paying only 200 US dollars. The businessmen also asked gem traders to consider the possibility of levying 2.5% on turnover from the 30% income tax levied on profits on gem exports. In order to avoid the tax levied by the government on cash transactions of more than Rs.500,000/=, the gem businessmen in the field are often tempted to carry out such high value cash transactions in cash and as a result, the businessmen who transact money fairly through banks and pay taxes properly to the government have to leave the field. The Chair of the Gems and Jewellery Authority told the committee that policies are currently being formulated to regulate the encroachment of foreign nationals into the gem industry in the country, and the committee emphasized the need for immediate implementation of the relevant policies. The jewelers demanded that the import of gold be allowed tax-free through a license based on 30% of the exporter\u2019s previous years\u2019 export earnings or foreign exchange earnings. Officials representing the Ministry of Finance pointed out that there is currently no import hurdle for businessmen registered with the Board of Investment to obtain a permit for temporary importation of gold for export processing. Only import of 24 carat gold jewellery has been stopped, they said. Sri Lanka Customs officials who were present said that under the TIEP Scheme (Temporary Import for Export Processing), gold can be imported into Sri Lanka without tax by registering with the Ministry of Industries as a raw material required by jewellery businessmen. However, due to the complexity of the process, businessmen expressed their reluctance to do so. The Committee also focused its attention on the proposal received from gem businessmen regarding the establishment of a Sri Lankan bank in China or the establishment of a Chinese bank in Sri Lanka to facilitate their business activities.

This was stated when the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report 2023 issued under Section 10 of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003, by the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization, and National Policies was taken up for consideration at the Committee meeting held in Parliament last week. MoF presented the fiscal status as of the end of June 2023. According to this report, the primary balance of the budget had a surplus of 0.1%. Revenue collection has increased by 41.9% YoY to 1,317 Bn, mainly as a result of the substantial increase in VAT on goods and services. Expenditure for the first half was 2,560 Bn, which witnessed an increase of 40.5% YoY. The biggest increase was in domestic interest expense, which rose by 51.6% to 1,273 Bn in the first half of this year. The Committee members raised various questions regarding the fiscal position, Economic performance, expenditure, and the performance of the state-owned enterprises based on the statistics presented by the officials present. Key concerns raised by the member of COPF were regarding the 11.5 percent contraction in the first quarter of 2023. The Committee questioned the root causes of such contraction and the specific measures taken to address such root causes preventing further economic downturns The Committee further questioned the sustainable plan of the Ministry to achieve growth in line with the Hon. President\u2019s Vision 2048. Though there was a substantial discussion on the plan for growth to reach a developed country, it was disclosed that there was no coherent strategy. The Committee was of the notion that the response to the Committee queries by the officials who were present, was ineffective and in lacks clarity. The Committee also queried the increase of taxes due naturally to inflation vs policy changes in taxes.

Sri Lanka has been a country that has followed this trend repetitively, having entered into 16 economic stabilisation programmes during 1965-2020, and recently entered into its 17th economic stabilisation programme with the IMF. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) estimates in 2019 (prior to the pandemic and crisis), showed that Sri Lanka needed to spend an additional 9 per cent of GDP per year to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. While the National Budget for 2023 aims to reduce the budget deficit from 10.2 per cent of GDP in 2022 to 7.9 per cent in 2023, mainly financed through domestic sources. This could limit the resources available for climate and sustainability-related interventions, and put pressure for higher interest rates. The country faces significant climate change risks as well. The global climate risk index for 2021, ranked Sri Lanka as the 23rd most affected country from extreme weather conditions during the period of 2000\u20132019. The country is also expected to see a 1.2 per cent annual GDP loss by 2050 due to effects of climate change. Therefore, moving into a conventional IMF agreement may not reap the full benefits required for Sri Lanka. In parallel to the IMF programme and negotiations with other multilateral agencies, alternative financing mechanisms should be explored in order to achieve Sri Lanka\u2019s development goals while overcoming the debt overhang. Alternative financing mechanisms, if effectively implemented, have the potential to provide long-term credit benefits by offering debt relief while also increasing investments that could strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s resilience to environmental risks. This can be a win-win situation for the country to achieve debt sustainability as well promote economic development in the country. Alternative Financing Options The Government of Sri Lanka has currently embarked on capacity development programmes for the adoption of alternative financing mechanisms such as green bonds. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) too has developed a policy and regulatory framework governing green bonds and in April 2023, the SEC approved rules for issuing green bonds for listed companies and statutory entities. This was subsequent to the publication of the green finance taxonomy by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which provided clarity on economic activities that are environmentally sustainable. Therefore, the landscape for adopting alternative financing mechanisms is being created, enabling a favorable environment for the use of alternative financing mechanisms in the future. An array of solutions can be considered for Sri Lanka, some of which are more appropriate than others in the country context and government priorities. Debt-for-climate or debt-for-sustainability swaps have proven to be a successful debt alleviation tool globally while promoting investment in green and sustainable projects. Carbon credits too can be a feasible and innovative way to address debt overhang and climate change simultaneously but requires more research on the impacts and scalability. Concessional and blended finance models too can provide favourable results while linking these to development objectives of Sri Lanka. In the long term, thematic bonds are also a tool that can be used to mobilise domestic and foreign capital. However, prior to a thematic bond issuance, access to the international finance markets should be established. This is expected to be facilitated by the completion of the IMF programme: A) Debt-for-Climate or Debt-for-Sustainability Swaps This is a financial instrument where the country would swap a promise (repayments on debt) with another promise (such as funding SDGs). Recently, in the aftermath of Sri Lanka\u2019s default, a global financial firm too expressed interest in restructuring USD 1 billion of debt for environmental purposes. Under a bilateral debt swap a debtor country and a creditor involve the cancellation or reduction of a portion of the debt in exchange for the debtor\u2019s commitment to invest in sustainability projects. For example, Sri Lanka could look to negotiate with China (one of its largest bilateral creditors), to swap some of its debt for investments in protecting its forests, wetlands and coral reefs, which are rich in biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services. This would reduce Sri Lanka\u2019s debt burden and free up fiscal space for other development priorities, while also enhancing its resilience. Other Country Experience In 2021, Belize swapped USD 553 million (total external commercial debt) through a blue bond arranged by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to the Belize government to finance a bond-for-cash exchange at 55 cents per dollar. This was in exchange for a 20-year commitment to expand and strengthen its marine protected area. The US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) provided political risk insurance for the blue bond. In 2022, Barbados swapped USD 150 million of sovereign debt with guarantees from the Inter- American Development Bank (IDB) and TNC to protect 30 per cent of the waters surrounding the island following a similar model of Belize. In 2023, Ecuador swapped USD 1.6 billion of the country\u2019s debt for conservation in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. To date, this is the largest debt-for-nature swap completed in the world. It consisted of an USD 85 million IDB guarantee and an USD 656 million DFC political-risk insurance. B) Carbon Credits Carbon credits are certificates that represent a reduction or avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions. It allows countries or entities that reduce their emissions below a certain level to sell their surplus emission reductions (or carbon credits) to countries or entities that need to comply with their emission targets or voluntarily offset their emissions. This can lower the cost of compliance for buyers and generate additional income for sellers. The Paris Agreement has introduced a new mechanism for international cooperation on climate action, known as Article 6. This mechanism allows countries to cooperate in achieving their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) through various approaches, such as bilateral or multilateral agreements, or carbon pricing instruments. Sri Lanka can also benefit from Article 6 by...", "content_hash": "cd3685e04cc697943110b467086c255a", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:49:19.824725", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:49:19.824739", "update_count": 0}, "228": {"source": "EconomicTimes.lk", "section": "economy", "title": "Colombo Bourse rallied with a massive gain for the fifth consecutive day", "url": "https://economictimes.lk/index.php/2023/06/14/colombo-bourse-rallied-with-a-massive-gain-for-the-fifth-consecutive-day/", "text": "The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) rallied with a massive gain fueling bullish optimism for the fifth consecutive day, surpassing and closing the day above 9,200 level after 1 \u00bd -month.

According to the World Energy Investment report, the global energy crisis that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine , as well as the growing affordability of renewables , has given rise to more sustainable alternatives, sparking a rise in investments. \u201cClean energy is moving fast \u2013 faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol in an IEA press release . \u201cFor every dollar invested in fossil fuels, about 1.7 dollars are now going into clean energy. Five years ago, this ratio was one-to-one. One shining example is investment in solar, which is set to overtake the amount of investment going into oil production for the first time.\u201d In 2023, approximately $2.8 trillion will be invested in energy globally, the report said. More than $1.7 trillion of that amount is projected to be invested in green energy technologies like electric vehicles (EVs), renewables, power grids, nuclear energy , heat pumps , low-emissions fuels and improvements in energy efficiency. The remaining more than $1 trillion will be invested in gas , oil and coal . Yearly investments in renewables are predicted to increase by 24 percent from 2021 to 2023, while fossil fuel investments are expected to rise just 15 percent. Advanced economies, as well as China , are responsible for more than 90 percent of the growth, which could jeopardize global energy equality if green energy investment increases aren\u2019t seen in other parts of the world. \u201cWeak grid infrastructure is a limiting factor for renewable investment in many developing economies, and here too current investment flows are highly concentrated. Advanced economies and China account for 80% of global spending and for almost all of the growth in recent years,\u201d the report said. Renewable energy technologies are projected to make up nearly 90 percent of power generation investment this year, led by solar energy . Investments in solar are expected to reach more than $1 billion per day this year, for a total of $382 billion in 2023, reported Reuters. Oil production investment is projected to be $371 billion. \u201cThis crowns solar as a true energy superpower. It is emerging as the biggest tool we have for rapid decarbonisation of the entire economy,\u201d said Dave Jones, energy think tank Ember\u2019s head of data insights, as Reuters reported. EV sales are projected to rise by one-third in 2023, following a jump last year, the press release said. Since 2021, sales of heat pumps worldwide have also grown by double digits. New initiatives like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and policies in Europe, China, Japan and other countries, as well as phases of vigorous economic growth coupled with unstable fossil fuel prices have helped prompt investments in clean energy. Oil and gas upstream spending is projected to increase by seven percent this year, primarily by large Middle Eastern national oil companies. New fossil fuel investments will increase by six percent to $950 billion this year, according to the IEA report. The increase in fossil fuel investments will lead to levels this year that are more than twice where they need to be in 2030 to be on track for the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario laid out by the IEA, the press release said. Last year, demand for coal was at a record high. In 2023, investment in coal is on a trajectory for a six-fold increase over the levels forecast to reach net zero goals for 2030. \u201cInvestment in coal supply is expected to rise by 10% in 2023, and is already well above pre-pandemic levels. Investment in new coal-fired power plants remains on a declining trend, but a warning sign came in 2022 with 40 GW of new coal plants being approved \u2013 the highest figure since 2016,\u201d the report said. The largest green energy investment deficiencies were found to be in developing and emerging nations. Higher interest rates, weak grid infrastructure, high capital costs, obscure policy rules and strained utilities have hampered investments in renewables in those countries. \u201cThe irony remains that some of the sunniest places in the world have the lowest levels of solar investment,\u201d Jones said, as reported by Reuters.

The coffee sector in Sri Lanka witnessed a notable transformation and attracted a multitude of market actors leading to significant growth in the industry. This surge in participation has propelled the industry to new heights. In this context, the Lanka Coffee Association (LCA) was established, as Sri Lanka\u2019s first coffee association brought together a variety of stakeholders in the coffee industry to fulfill the goal of developing the specialty coffee sector through several initiatives conducted over the past two years since its inception. A key activity that marked the comeback of the Sri Lankan coffee industry was hosting the first-ever Sri Lankan coffee festival in 2022. Following the success of this inaugural event, the LCA, in partnership with MDF and Jetwing Group, hosted the second Sri Lankan Coffee Festival on the 19th of May at Jetwing Colombo 07. The Colombo Coffee Company, Temple Grounds, and Soul Coffee were gold, silver, and bronze sponsors for the event. Rinosh Nasar, Chairman, Lanka Coffee Association mentioned, \u201cThe Sri Lankan Coffee Festival hosted by the LCA, is a celebration of our rich coffee heritage and the incredible opportunities ahead. At the LCA, we are focused on pushing the growth of the Sri Lankan coffee industry from plant to cup and uplifting the livelihood of our coffee farmers.\u201d The 2023 Sri Lanka Coffee Festival not only showcased the quality and diversity of local coffee but also emphasised the importance of promoting investment in this growing sector. The event featured various activities, including panel discussions on the \u201cUpward Journey of the Coffee Industry in Sri Lanka: The Challenges Faced and The Way Forward\u201d. Moreover, the festival provided an excellent platform for coffee growers, processors, and roasters to showcase their products and network with potential buyers and investors. The Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and Maldives,  Paul Stephens, was the guest of honor at the festival and delivered the keynote address. He shared Australia\u2019s commitment to supporting the growth of the specialty coffee sector in Sri Lanka and mentioned, \u201cWe are pleased to witness Sri Lanka\u2019s continued commitment towards sustainable development of the coffee sector, and the Australian Government will continue to be a proponent to drive prosperity and inclusivity through our continued collaboration.\u201d At the mini-exhibition, Colombo Coffee Company, Temple Grounds, Soul Coffee, Helanta Coffee, Elpitiya Plantations, Valli products presented their coffee, allowing the public to experience the unique taste and aroma of locally grown coffee. Concurrently, the finals of the LCA Barista Championship took place with the emerging winner being Suraj Nipunasiri from Butter Boutique (Regional barista championships were hosted in Dambulla, Galle, and Negombo regions throughout April).

Coupled with high humidity, the high temperatures make people uncomfortable and sweaty. This year, the Department of Meteorology went so far as to issue heat warnings for several districts, cautioning residents against exposure to high heat that can have harmful health implications. As neighboring South Asian countries are scorched by a severe heat wave, the unusually high-temperature rise is impacting people and their daily lives, a change that causes worry among locals about climate risk. \u201cAs the temperature has risen to about 36 degrees Celsius [96.8 degrees Fahrenheit], Sri Lanka has experienced about 3 degrees Celsius [5.4 degrees Fahrenheit] increase of the daily maximum temperature during the recent heat stress period,\u201d says Shiromani Jayawardena , the deputy director of the Department of Meteorology . Exposure to excessive heat along with high humidity may prove stressful to the body and in extreme cases can even kill, so the department assesses the situation and issues warnings to the public to remain cautious, Jayawardena said. This year, an unusual heat wave with high temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius impacted South and Central Asia. As Sri Lanka is an island, it did not have the same impacts as neighboring countries, but climate models project risks of similar heat waves after 2030 under emission projections, Jayawardena told Mongabay. Increased heat stress is an indication of climate change, and a recent study found that deadly heat stress is becoming a common occurrence across South Asia even with 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) global warming. Lareef Zubair , a scientist at the Foundation for Environment, Climate, and Technology ( FECT ) said heat stress in Sri Lanka is rising to dangerous levels for a larger share of the population due to climate change. Sri Lankans are now experiencing more warm nights\u00a0compared with cold nights. A study found that annually averaged mean minimum temperatures are increasing, reducing the gap between maximum and minimum temperatures. Temperatures in Sri Lanka have been rising faster than the global average at about 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.24 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade, Zubair said. \u201cBy 2019, 2020 and 2022, The heat stress reached risk levels particularly in low elevation parts of Sri Lanka from April to June and this is a clear indication of the role of warming temperatures,\u201d Zubair said. The data also indicate that the number of days the heat index reaches \u201cextreme caution\u201d levels is on the rise, the climate scientist said. Urbanized areas are more prone to excessive heat due to the heat island effect in which human activities make the urban environment significantly warmer than rural areas, said Erandathie Lokupitiya , a professor of environmental science at the University of Colombo. \u201cIn an urban setting, there are buildings, tarred roads and cemented pavements which can absorb heat and then release them,\u201d she said. Studies also show how the heat in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial capital, has risen over time. In this era of climate change, cities should be designed strategically to mitigate increasing threats emanating from heat stresses, said Jagath Munasinghe , an urban planner at the University of Moratuwa. \u201cThere are wind corridors that can help to naturally cool the urban environment, reducing the heat through a natural windfall. Colombo is a coastal town, so there is sea breeze that can help build strong wind tunnels if planned carefully,\u201d Munasinghe said. Air flows to , wetlands and open spaces father inland that could receive continuous airflow. It could provide an effective method to reduce the city\u2019s heat, Munasinghe told Mongabay. The plants are nature\u2019s air purifiers, as their evaporation adds water vapor to the atmosphere. But urban areas are rapidly losing greenery, making them unhealthy and uncomfortable to live in, so regreening cities should become a priority, Munasinghe said. \u201cTrees can be planted along the wind corridors, so the air will get naturally cool,\u201d Munasinghe said. Greening cities has multiple advantages, but vegetation should be planted well based on a feasibility study to make it sustainable, he added. Not only humans but animals, plants and ecosystems should brace for the inevitable impacts from increased heat stress. \u201cThe impact would be more for smaller animals; for example, it is estimated that a small increase in temperature could wipe out some insects and sensitive animals,\u201d Lokupitiya said. However, corals may be the most impacted by such heat stress, as higher ocean temperatures can make corals bleach and die. \u201cMay and June are the months when corals get bleached due to increased temperature resulting from extreme heat. These delicate organisms get severely impacted by heat stress,\u201d said Arjan Rajasuriya , a coral scientist and a former researcher at the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency . Some corals revive and are resilient to heat stress, but in a prolonged event, more corals bleach. The impact could be worse for corals in shallower seas and those in areas where water is stagnated, Rajasuriya added. Sri Lanka needs more research to analyze the possible impacts of such heat stress and overall impacts of climate change, said Devaka Weerakoon , fauna coordinator for the IUCN Red List. The impacts of the changing climate could be greater along the borders of the country\u2019s climatic zones, so more studies are required to project the possible impacts of climate change on living organisms, Weerakoon told Mongabay.

The company\u2019s Board Of Directors (BOD) proposed to delist the ordinary voting shares from the Official List of the CSE and entered into an agreement with the controlling shareholder and parent company, Nestl\u00e9 S.A. (effective holding of 91.95% in the company) to offer an exit price of Rs.1,500.0 per share at a 34% premium to the closing price of Rs. 1,120.25 last traded pre-announcement, for the remaining 6,054 shareholders holding 8.05% stake in the company. As per the Delisting Rules, the BOD requires approval of the shareholders by way of a special resolution of 75% of the shareholders present at the meeting. Nestl\u00e9 announced that an AGM will be held on the 30th of June 2023 to consider the delisting resolution. \u201cIt may be possible to outvote Nestl\u00e9\u2019s delisting resolution based on the \u2018one shareholder, one vote\u2019 principle at the AGM, and considering the past situations involving Property Development PLC (PDL) & AIA, it is highly probable that there will be an attempt to increase the exit offer price,\u201d First Capital Research (FCR) said in a report. With the exception of its parent Nestl\u00e9 S.A., no individual shareholder listed on the register possesses more than a 1% stake in Nestl\u00e9 Lanka. However, institutions such as the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, EPF, as well as foreign and local funds, form part of the minority shareholders. In recent times, PGP Glass Ceylon PLC which attempted to delist had eventually failed as the proposal was refused by minority shareholders. Property Development PLC (PDL) and AIA delisting proposals were also rejected by minority shareholders based on a \u2018one shareholder, one vote\u2019 principle. PDL\u2019s delisting decision took over 5 years after the proposal was first announced. It delisted by paying LKR 183.0 per share, which is more than 40% of what was offered in 2018. However, the company\u2019s shares did not witness a comparable increase in value as the Nestl\u00e9 share, nor did it offer substantial dividend payments like Nestl\u00e9. In the end, the company, rather than its primary shareholder, Bank of Ceylon, acquired the remaining shares from the minority shareholders. In AIA\u2019s case, a price of Rs.2,500.0 per share was paid against an original exit offer price of Rs.1,000.0. Nestl\u00e9 Lanka believes that the Exit Offer Price provides a fair value as its average daily turnover of Rs.2.2 million accounts for only 0.0037% of its total market cap of Rs.60.0 billion. Hence, it strongly believes that accepting the offer at its \u201cattractive and fair premium\u201d price would be in the best interest of its shareholders, as holding shares in an unquoted company with illiquid shares offers no advantageous prospects.

Exports in March marked the lowest in three years, said Yohan Lawrence, Secretary General of the Joint Apparel Association\u00a0Forum\u00a0(JAAF), which is the industry\u2019s apex body. \u201cGiven the slowdown in demand we are seeing now, a $1 billion reduction in exports this year is not unreasonable,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cOur projection is it could be five to six more months before we see a recovery in global demand.\u201d Shipments to the Unites States, the country\u2019s biggest buyer, dropped by 22% to $470 million in the first quarter. Exports to the European Union fell 13% to $344 million while first-quarter exports to the United Kingdom were down 10% to $167.7 million, according to the latest JAAF data. A steep 66% power tariff hike in February has also hit Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness, Lawrence added.

Bouquets (as usual from within the ranks of the administration, its hangers on and chamber types) and brickbats (from across the aisle and opponents of the incumbents) aside, there\u2019s surely a sense of relief that despite predictions to the contrary, Budget 2026 doesn\u2019t contain any new taxes! From a layman\u2019s perspective, the big picture is that our economy continues to reflect the diktat laid out by the IMF in collaboration with the former government, under the fund\u2019s US$ 3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) \u2013 and that too is a relief, even if it means that the incumbents continue to ditch the promises they made to the electorate. Sri Lanka doesn\u2019t have a choice but to do stay on course. And that\u2019s where the \u2018good news\u2019 ends\u2026 Our fellow citizens who continue to live below the poverty line maybe wondering when their turn out of the misery (that too was an election promise) will come \u2013 with or without the IMF. It is a crying shame on us all that more than a quarter of the citizenry are still finding it difficult or even impossible to make ends meet. Not even the deflationary milieu that we are slowly but surely coming out of has made a difference to the poor. In the light of the plight of the poor, the decision to purchase brand-new double cabs for members of parliament (and controversially, this announcement came only three days after a Rs. 12.5 billion tender for 1,775 such vehicles was closed, reportedly just a week after it was advertised) flies in the face not only of its ideology but also taxpayers who continue to suffer the burdens that go with a high tax regime. The government\u2019s anticorruption drive has also been the talk of the town for some time. Opposition MP Dr. Harsha de Silva, who opened the budget debate the day after it was presented in parliament, said he supports it but rightly cautioned that the modus operandi shouldn\u2019t be driven by political interests. To this end, he cited the controversial release of containers from the port, the sugar import scam and the e-visa swindle \u2013 and one is inclined to add the pending cases against government bigwigs that seem to have taken a backseat as allegations against their predecessors take centre stage. So the government faces a defining test of credibility\u2026 Will it hold its own members accountable under the standards it has promised to uphold? And is the fight against corruption selective? Meanwhile, the plight of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) has also come under the radar for all the right reasons. In a what seems like a desperate attempt to widen the tax net \u2013 when the big money tax evaders go scot free \u2013 the government announced a reduction in the VAT threshold from Rs. 60 million a year to 36 million from April 2026, which will undoubtedly burden the smallest of our businesses with the convoluted administration of value added tax and compel them to raise prices \u2013 and this in turn will be borne by consumers who continue to be challenged by the cost of living. And while we have been assured that our forex reserves are healthy and Sri Lanka will be in a position to repay its debts when the moratorium ends in 2028, there have been reports to the contrary as our dependency on imports (motor vehicles included) shows no signs of abating. If there\u2019s one marker on this score, it may well be the value of our currency \u2013 which has fallen by around four percent (from Rs. 293 against the greenback at the beginning of this government\u2019s term late last year to around 305 rupees today).

Instead, it is what gives our economic survival value. That is what the NPP seems to be settling down to do \u2013 i.e. going into survival mode \u2013 instead of expediting some of the promises in its election winning manifesto. It has not yet capitalised on the electoral goodwill extended to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) led progres\u00adsives to fast track the process of abolishing the executive presidency. The JVP, having been proscribed by successive political establishments in the past, only recently convinced a polity disgruntled with crony capitalism and systemic corruption to provide it with a mandate to govern. The discourse about eliminating the excesses of an office (that has swung like a pendulum between being odious and oddly effective in operationalising the paternalistic state) is perhaps not a priority compared to economic survival. But it is incumbent on those who suffered under its jackboot to jump-start the draughting process constitutionally speaking, and be seen to be doing so \u2013 if only to safeguard its present ethos and future credibility. Hornswoggling with the timeworn excuse that the executive presidency is still required to steady the ship of state in the face of strong headwinds in the geopolitical domain will not cut it with a savvier electorate. Sundry administrations since 1978 \u2013 and despite the depredations of 1983-1989 and 2005-2015, plus the political fiascos of power sharing in 2001-2004 and 2015-2019 \u2013 may have got away with it. But civil society can scare forebear to avail itself of the cardinal opportunity now to keep up the pressure on the apposite ministries and government in general. Surely, the authoritarian \u2013 yet, strangely incompetent \u2013 strongman governments of the past, virtually since independence and especially from 2019 to 2022, and the subversion of the rule of law and order through \u2018government by gazette\u2019, cannot be forgotten by a long-suffering citizenry? Nor can or must the free media pander to partisan agendas by failing to remind even a government that has done a great deal of good to date in translating the benefit of regime change into the boon of system change that there is no free pass on its promises. Perhaps in its weaker all too human moments \u2013 people having feet of clay, despite what their propagandists may say to the contrary \u2013 the NPP may wish us to be stricken with temporary amnesia. Far be it from us to be unduly alarmist. But electorates willing to abdicate their responsibility to keep their elected governments on the straight and narrow through the democratic, constitutional and legal means available to them have seen the national interest laid low too many times before. And lest sociopolitical bankruptcy be added to the balance sheet already replete with moral turpitude of regimes past and fiscal ruin in recent times, now is the time \u2013 as the government of the day enters its second year in neutral gear \u2013 to apply the brakes on some slippages. Before the inertia gives the regime a wrong impetus to stay its lacklustre course as regards far-reaching systemic changes that could be affected by a new social contract. The contention that the NPP motored along on the previous administration\u2019s fiscal policies may be a misconception more than a canard \u2013 after all, the IMF had its strictures on Sri Lanka no matter which party or movement of any particular ideological persuasion tried to deviate from the straight and narrow from the terms of a bailout or Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the third tranche of which would be crucial for recovery momentum to be maintained. And no matter how rhetoricians on any side of the politico-economic divide may spin the salutary economic progress made to date, the bottom line that is becoming increasingly obvious as time goes by \u2013 at least to those with their heads not buried in the sands of small successes at civics and governance \u2013 is that the country cannot afford to coast along on performing well fiscally until it hits the brick wall of 2028. That is when Sri Lanka will have to stand on its own two feet vis-\u00e0-vis the world of international finance. Or fall on its sword again. Asking the powers that be to prioritise both economic recovery and sociopolitical reform at the same times may be akin to requesting the performer to compare the superlatives of apples and oranges while juggling both fruit. And it is also ludicrous to do so in only the government\u2019s second year. But we\u2019ve delayed doing what is not only right but urgently required too many times before not to know that mere survival mode isn\u2019t enough.

Understanding what inclusivity truly means can be challenging, as its definitions vary. Depending on the context, definitions focus on different aspects of inclusivity such as providing equal access, welcoming diversity, addressing inequality and avoiding exclusion. If one were to synthesise these variations and introduce a little common sense, we may be able to reason that to be inclusive is to disregard anything that might differentiate individuals in a way that limits or excludes them. Ensuring inclusivity requires focus on distinct aspects based on the context in question. In the case of education, it\u2019s about ensuring that regardless of background, identity, gender or abilities, all students are provided with equal opportunities to access learning content, participate in related activities and succeed. What\u2019s paradoxical is that historically, education was a means of exclusion. A straight-As student was in a much better position to secure a scholarship from a good university than one who had average grades. A person with a formal degree was considered much more eligible for a job than one who didn\u2019t have a qualification. Yet today, while formal achievements still stand (at least for now), the measurement criteria and the very definition of success have changed. Education is viewed as an enabler rather than a differentiator; it is seen as adding value to individuals and not so much as a means of measuring them against each other. Whether the very core of education is inclusion or exclusion is a debate for another time\u2026 or perhaps never. Yet, in a world where we need to combat illnesses and climate change, and ensure survival, the need to ensure inclusivity in education so that all students have equal access to enriching their lives through learning is more significant than ever. Discussions of diversity and inclusion are often smothered with gender, race, nationality or even skin colour, but there\u2019s so much more to this. Disabilities \u2013 be they physical or mental \u2013 make accessibility a crucial yet challenging aspect of education. From hearing issues to dyslexia and even the inability to handle pressure can cause students to lack equal access to learning content. Even aspects such as personality can impact how a student experiences learning. While presentations might be a breeze for extroverts, they may be nightmares for others \u2013 so we\u2019re faced with the question of whether it is fair. Where people hail from, their cultural upbringing, social status, income levels and even exposure to techno\u00adlogy can all contribute to discrimination against them. For instance, some students might come from households that have high scholarly expectations while others may hail from homes that expect them to quickly join the workforce to support their family\u2019s finances. These backgrounds and expectations influence students\u2019 learning experiences differently, which is why ensuring inclusivity in education is tough. Is inclusivity in education a white whale? It does appear to be so; but it can also be handled in a simpler and more humane way. After all, humans \u2013 even those in the same family \u2013 are different but we\u2019ve made it work. Peer learning is a natural phenomenon because people learn from and with each another. We imitate others, influence others and initiate learning experiences with others. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve survived as a group throughout millennia. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ve built towns, cities, nations and organisations. So perhaps it\u2019s a matter of applying this natural instinct to help us educate ourselves today. Human connections appear to be challenging to nurture and maintain in the age of AI, technology, distance learning and Zoom classes but they\u2019re what will matter the most. When learning with others through peer coaching, group work or simply being classmates, students engage in conversations, get to know each other\u2019s thought processes, offer and receive feedback, and develop skills and capabilities. They also get to know what makes them different and what they have in common. Learners then become more tolerant of differences and more appreciative of diversity. Therefore, inclusion is an inherent part of how we learn rather than simply a goal to achieve.", "content_hash": "e75e0dd64633e17e3c4335be66cab20a", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:23.621675", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:23.621687", "update_count": 0}, "246": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "LOW-TECH EDUCATION", "url": "https://lmd.lk/low-tech-education-dec-2025/", "text": "In the Swiss canton of Nidwalden, schools began the 2025 term without personal digital devices \u2013 a decision based on pragmatism rather than ideology. Administrators cite declining attention spans, fractured lessons and the operational challenges of maintaining digital infrastructure as factors in this development. Early reports indicate that lessons are running more efficiently now and class-room management has become simpler. The move reflects a wider reassessment across Europe where policy makers are reconsidering the balance between technological investment and measurable educational outcomes. Finland, which was long regarded as a model for digital integration in schools, also scaled back device use. Mobile phones are restricted during the school day and printed textbooks have returned to primary classrooms. Educators report improved comprehension, a steadier focus and a calmer classroom environment. In Germany, federal states including Bavaria and Hesse are also formalising restrictions on smartphones. Officials note that the presence of screens often contributes to distraction rather than engagement. This isn\u2019t a rejection of technology but instead, a response to operational and cognitive limitations that have been observed over years of implementation. Furthermore, maintaining digital infrastructure is costly since tablets deteriorate quickly, platforms require regular updates, and technical support consumes staff time and budgets. Meanwhile, the pedagogical outcomes are also inconsistent. While some students benefit from digital learning tools, others struggle to retain attention. Reading and writing habits weakened by screen reliance are slow to recover, and create long-term challenges in literacy development. The shift is also reshaping the market for private education. Several European schools now market themselves as being low-tech or \u2018device light\u2019; they\u2019re placing more emphasis on concentration, handwriting and discussion. Parents are increasingly willing to pay premiums for learning environments that limit screen time, and enhance focus and mental wellbeing. What began as a policy adjustment has become a differentiator in the education marketplace, signalling that restraint can be a competitive advantage. Teachers report subtle but measurable benefits in classroom dynamics. Without devices, lessons progress at a steadier pace. Students are more likely to engage with material and each other, and disciplinary issues are reduced. In Germany, head teachers note that lunchtime conversation has replaced the habitual silence of phone use. These observations, while anecdotal, suggest that reducing digital interference can enhance the learning experience. However, there are counterarguments as critics caution that limiting technology risks leaving students less prepared for a digital world. Digital literacy remains a core requirement for modern employment and total exclusion is neither practical nor desirable. Supporters contend that competency doesn\u2019t require continuous exposure; and instead, structured and deliberate engagement can achieve the same outcomes, while preserving attention and cognitive endurance. The education tech sector, which has relied on constant device adoption and scalable platforms, must adapt to changing demand. Solutions now need to prioritise moderation, offline functionality and focussed engagement over uninterrupted screen time. Policy makers are also reconsidering budgets, weighing the costs of digital infrastructure against outcomes and exploring whether investment in low-tech alternatives may offer higher returns. Europe\u2019s experience with tech free or low-tech classrooms signals a broader lesson for education and business alike. Technology by itself doesn\u2019t ensure improved results, and success in the classroom relies on student engagement and the quality of teacher guidance. By reassessing the role of digital tools, schools are demonstrating that measured adoption rather than unrestrained implementation can be both cost-effective and pedagogically sound. The shift encourages a broader debate about resource allocation, teacher training and long-term curriculum design. It also highlights how strategic decisions in education can influence outcomes, investment priorities and even workforce preparedness.

These men included former premiers Yasuhiro Nakasone, Noboru Takeshita, Fumio Kishida, Shigeru Ishiba, Naoto Kan and Shinzo Abe. Nevertheless, the Diet seems to be under the spell of the LDP, which has occupied government benches for most of the past 70 years \u2013 and it has even elected the nation\u2019s first female Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Of late however, the Jimint\u014d (as it is known) appears to have lost much of its political lustre among voters due to financial scandals, a disunited leadership and national economic losses. Ishiba\u2019s recent resignation saw the party being forced to form a precarious minority government in October with the Japan Innovation Party (JIP) after the Buddhist backed Komeito \u2013 a party of self-proclaimed \u2018humanitarian socialism\u2019 \u2013 pulled out of the governing alliance. Though JIP will sit with the government, it will not serve in Takaichi\u2019s cabinet. CLAIM TO FAME As soon as Takaichi won the leadership of the LDP \u2013 and subsequently, the nation \u2013 her past role as a heavy metal drummer during her college days was the first item of interest to be published by media houses throughout the world. Her political career has been and continues to be ultraconservative however, even though the Jimint\u014d calls itself a \u2018liberal coalition.\u2019 The JIP is certainly not liberal: it remains a conservative, centre right to right-wing populist political party. But the humanitarian socialist Komeito, which withdrew from the government alliance, had a more dovish and centrist approach. Although the LDP leans towards traditional conservative policies such as low taxes and minimal restrictions on businesses, it supports a strong welfare state. However, Takaichi is a strong advocate for self-reliance through economic growth and incentives, and has been extremely critical of policies that promote dependency. She favours the Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which promotes deficit spending on issues that the government considers important. This is contrary to mainstream neoclassical economics that perceives government debt and deficits as significant constraints, which require careful management. Takaichi is also a firm follower of former prime minister Abe\u2019s leadership style, and has been pushing for the government to play a more assertive role in Japan\u2019s military and revision of Article 9 of the constitution, which renounces war as a sovereign right and prohibits the maintenance of a military force with the potential for armed conflict. She is also a regular visitor to the Yasukuni Shrine, which was founded in 1869 by Emperor Meiji to commemorate those who died serving their nation. This is a controversial place for the Chinese, as well as North and South Koreans, since it also honours 14 convicted Class A Japanese war criminals. These war criminals were enshrined during a secret ceremony in 1978 by the shrine\u2019s chief priest, former naval officer Nagayoshi Matsudaira, after he rejected the verdicts handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) \u2013 a.k.a. the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. RIGHT-WING TILT Takaichi favours ultraconservative policies on many social issues including same-sex marriage, female succession to the imperial throne, revisiting Article 9 of Japan\u2019s constitution and strengthening that country\u2019s alliance with the US. She also promotes a nationalistic perspective of Japanese history and favours rewriting it. Takaichi has even criticised the Murayama Statement of 1995, which apologises for her country\u2019s wartime atrocities and colonial rule, and the Kono Statement of 1993 that specifically acknowledges Japan\u2019s role in the coercion and management of \u2018comfort women\u2019 during WWII. RED FLAG Though Takaichi broke through the glass ceiling in Japan and became the first female leader of her country, she hasn\u2019t translated her promises of gender diversity into action. Her cabinet of ministers is still male dominated; although for the sake of tokenism, she has awarded the finance portfolio to Satsuki Katayama and appointed Kimi Onoda as Minister for Economic Security, Foreign Nationals and Immigration. It seems that Takaichi\u2019s hawkish nationalist perceptions won her the backing of the Japan Innovation Party. In spite of it helping her secure a victory however, Takaichi\u2019s alliance is jittery, and she will need to secure the support of opposition parties to pass legislation. This is a serious red flag for the continued duration of her government. As a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Abe, it\u2019s possible that Takaichi will emulate his policies \u2013 particularly with regard to the economy and establishment of a stronger military. But her tenuous grip on power may not enable Japan\u2019s new premier to achieve very much in terms of constitutional amendments. She has always been an ardent admirer of former British prime minister Baroness Margaret Thatcher and her anti-immigration policies. And in addition to being anti-immigration and hawkish, Takaichi also promotes an anti-China policy. All these ultraconservative qualities, together with her admiration for Abe and a desire to rewrite history, have already endeared her to US President Donald Trump who shares many of her likes and dislikes.", "content_hash": "381a803b4f589dc97a0f1493a641ebed", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:28.378796", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:28.378827", "update_count": 0}, "248": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "NEW FRONTIERS", "url": "https://lmd.lk/new-frontiers-dec-2025/", "text": "LITTLE MONSTERS An oddly cute and slightly monstrous looking vinyl figure called Labubu has become one of the most sought after collectibles of late. Its journey from an art toy to a global sensation began with Hong Kong\u2019s long tradition of toy craftsmanship. In the 1970s and \u201980s, its factories were central to toy manufacturing for major brands such as Mattel and Bandai. The industrial base nurtured small, independent studios that experimented with design and production by blending creativity with technical skills. Out of this culture emerged designer Kasing Lung, who created Labubu alongside Howard Lee\u2019s design house How2Work. Their early versions were handmade, hand painted and sold in limited batches. When Chinese toy giant Pop Mart partnered with its creators in 2019, Labubu leapt from niche circles to mainstream fame. Its quirky proportions, mischievous grin, and blend of cute and creepy charm struck a universal chord. Labubu\u2019s success highlights Hong Kong\u2019s enduring influence on toy culture \u2013 a bridge between local artistry and global pop appeal. What began as a small batch figure has become an icon of modern collectibles, which shows that craftsmanship, nostalgia and innovation still have the power to move markets. CLEAN AUSTRALIA Australia is charting a bold course towards a national grid that\u2019s powered entirely by renewable energy \u2013 a turning point in the country\u2019s history. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which oversees the national electricity domain, says the shift isn\u2019t simply a dream but an inevitable evolution. Coal power plants are being steadily retired; and in their place wind, solar, hydropower and large-scale battery systems are expanding rapidly. AEMO predicts that around 90 percent of coal generation will be gone by 2035 with the remainder closing down by the end of the decade. Renewables already make up roughly a third of Australia\u2019s power and on some days, they supply more than three-quarters of national demand. The challenge now lies in maintaining grid stability for services once provided by the heavy spinning turbines of coal power plants. Engineers are responding with new solutions such as synchronous condensers, upgraded gas turbines and long duration battery storage. With abundant sunlight, wind resources and widespread rooftop solar, Australia has unique advantages. As coal fades, the nation is crafting a global model for how advanced economies can achieve reliable clean energy. ELECTRIC FERRARI Ferrari is entering the electric age with its first fully electric vehicle (EV) Elettrica \u2013 a model that aims to prove an EV can still feel, sound and drive like a true Ferrari. Set for release next year, the Elettrica will feature four electric motors that produce over 1,000 horsepower and are powered by a 122 kWh battery capable of more than 500 kilometres of range. It\u2019s expected to accelerate from zero to 100 km/h in only 2.5 seconds, matching Ferrari\u2019s top combustion models for raw performance. However, what truly sets this car apart is its approach to sound: rather than relying on artificial audio or digital effects, Ferrari has developed an innovative acoustic system that amplifies the car\u2019s natural mechanical tones. Sensors capture the vibrations and frequencies from the electric motors, then filter and enhance them to create a responsive organic sound that changes with driving intensity. Ferrari says it\u2019s more than a gimmick and represents a continuation of the brand\u2019s legacy of crafting emotion through engineering, ensuring that even in the silent era of EVs, drivers will experience the thrill and character that define the marque. NEW TECH OASIS Paraguay is positioning itself as the next major hub for technology in South America by leveraging its unique combination of green energy, young talent and low costs. Spearheading this vision is Paraguayan entrepreneur Gabriela Cibils, who spent years in Silicon Valley before returning home. She aims to transform the country into a tech powerhouse that\u2019s capable of attracting global giants such as Google and OpenAI. A key advantage for Paraguay is its abundance of cheap renewable electricity. The Itaipu Dam, one of the world\u2019s largest hydroelectric plants, supplies 90 percent of the nation\u2019s power and a portion of Brazil\u2019s too. This makes Paraguay the largest exporter of clean energy globally and the steady renewable supply is ideal for energy intensive operations such as AI data centres. The government is actively supporting the initiative by building a US$ 20 million digital park near the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport, which is Asunci\u00f3n\u2019s main aerodrome. It will host private enterprises, research facilities and a university focussed on technology. With an average age of 27, Paraguay\u2019s workforce is young, and increasingly trained in software development, coding and robotics. Programmes such as Girls Who Code are helping to close the gender gap in tech. Despite bureaucratic hurdles, leaders remain optimistic. By combining innovation, education and sustainable infrastructure, Paraguay aims to turn its natural and human resources into a thriving technological ecosystem \u2013 potentially South America\u2019s Silicon Valley.", "content_hash": "aacaa20b41143a5bd92c601adb2280ee", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:30.342085", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:30.342092", "update_count": 0}, "249": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "TOMORROW\u2019S WORLD", "url": "https://lmd.lk/tomorrows-world-dec-2025/", "text": "Your email address will not be published.

And the leadership has been spending a great deal of time and effort in that province. It also met with persons from different walks of life prior to launching new development projects that will benefit the northern populace. These engagements signify not only physical connectivity but also a rebuilding of trust between the state and the people of this once war-torn region. Recently, a minister was in Jaffna to launch the widening of the access road to the Kurikadduwan Jetty, which is the launching point for ferries that transport passengers to the small islands off the Jaffna peninsula. He announced that the development of the access road has officially begun and is marking a major step forward in improving connectivity to the islands. The most significant of these is Nainativu Island, popularly known as Nagadeepa \u2013 one of the most sacred religious sites for Buddhists. Thousands of pilgrims from the rest of the country visit Nagadeepa every day with the numbers soaring over long weekends. Therefore, the improvement of the access road will save valuable time for these pilgrims, and provide relief to teachers, government employees and residents who rely on the ferry service for their daily travel. Meanwhile, the population of Delft Island is only around 5,000 today. Though the government plans to develop the Kurikadduwan Jetty next year, merely facilitating local tourism won\u2019t revive the economy. During the ceremony to begin work on the access road, the minister repeated the government\u2019s pledge to treat all people equally regardless of ethnicity, religion or region. It\u2019s due to this pledge that the people of the north gave the government an unprecedented mandate. But in developing the national economy, the administration must now widen its horizons from a micro to a macro level. For development to be meaningful however, it mustn\u2019t stop at road widening and jetty renovations; it must link the north not only to Colombo but also to larger markets \u2013 particularly the rapidly prospering economy across the Palk Strait. The real boost lies in building economic links with India, which is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies, and a regional powerhouse in manufacturing, technology and services. It offers what Sri Lanka urgently needs \u2013 capital, manufacturing partnerships, technology transfers, and a sprawling market for agricultural, fisheries and service exports. For decades, Sri Lanka\u2019s development model depended on foreign loans for consumption and public sector projects. Today, the country needs foreign direct investments (FDI) to expand its factories, processing centres, logistics hubs and renewable energy installations. Where the development of the north and east is concerned, the stakes are high. Young people are frustrated by the lack of employment opportunities and constantly seek to leave our shores. For decades, these regions were seen as a burden or problem to be contained. Today, they must be seen as assets and strategic gateways to regional integration. Internal development alone won\u2019t sustain economic transformation: Sri Lanka needs FDIs to increase its production base and India is the most accessible source of such investments. Previous governments had entered into agreements with India to revive the Kankesanthurai (KKS) Port, and improve the ferry service between Sri Lanka and India. In 2017, India agreed to extend a line of credit to rehabilitate the harbour. Then in 2019, both governments agreed to explore the possibility of expanding the port into a passenger and freight terminal linking KKS with Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu. These plans must now be accelerated \u2013 and KKS shouldn\u2019t be seen merely as a ferry point but a commercial gateway for exports, industrial inputs and tourism. For Sri Lanka to truly realise its economic potential, development must extend beyond local improvements and small islands. Strategic projects such as the Kankesanthurai Port offer an opportunity to connect the north and rest of the island with the regional economy. By aligning micro level development with macro level investments, Sri Lanka can create jobs, boost production and anchor long-term growth. While small steps like road widening are essential, the real transformation will be seen only when those roads lead not only to jetties but new markets and investors \u2013 as well as a prosperous economic future.", "content_hash": "8623d0d8626572b4b1e76b030334a1dc", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:34.670158", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:34.670173", "update_count": 0}, "251": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "RUBBER INDUSTRY", "url": "https://lmd.lk/rubber-industry-dec-2025/", "text": "Once a powerhouse of Sri Lanka\u2019s export economy, the rubber industry is facing a crisis: natural rubber production has declined from around 150,000 metric tonnes a decade ago to only 65,000 tonnes today. \u201cThe main ingredient in rubber manufacturing is natural rubber; however, local rubber production has collapsed due to the absence of a structured plan for replanting trees. Excessive rain and the lack of incentives for new planting activity have further impacted output,\u201d remarks Dr. Kulatunga Rajapaksa. The long gestation period of seven years for rubber trees to mature is another deterrent for potential planters. He avers: \u201cFarmers are unable to earn during those seven years; and without a support mechanism, smallholders simply can\u2019t afford to replant.\u201d \u201cA replanting scheme launched in 2015 covered 5,000 hectares in Monaragala, which yielded positive results and made it the highest rubber producing region. Unfortunately, the government at the time discontinued the scheme without replanting in the next designated area,\u201d he laments. Additionally, excessive rainfall in traditional rubber growing regions reduced the number of tapping days, compelling workers to exit the trade. As a result of these challenges, large companies shifted away from rubber cultivation to palm oil and tea, which have shorter cycles and lower labour costs. RISING IMPORTS Rajapaksa observes: \u201cWith domestic supply collapsing, manufacturers turned to imports to keep factories running. Many invested heavily in machinery and saw no choice but to import natural rubber to sustain operations.\u201d \u201cThis has undermined a key national advantage. Previously, our exports were 100 percent local rubber. Today, a substantial share is imported, depleting foreign exchange reserves,\u201d he maintains. The rubber glove manufacturing segment \u2013 where demand surged during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 has also had to rely on imported latex. DETERRENTS Rajapaksa asserts that \u201chigh energy costs and outdated labour regulations have deterred foreign investors. Rubber manufacturing is energy intensive; and our energy prices are among the highest in the region.\u201d He points out that even if a factory remains closed for a month, kVA charges must still be paid. \u201cWhat incentive is there for investors when we face a labour shortage, lack of local rubber and high energy costs?\u201d he asks. Labour regulations also hinder competitiveness. \u201cWorking on Sundays, which are mandatory holidays, costs a company three times the normal overtime rate \u2013 including an additional day off. No other country has such a system,\u201d he notes. Securing land from the government is another tough proposition, he says: \u201cAccess to industrial land is difficult; and without it, we can\u2019t build the necessary infrastructure.\u201d BOTTLENECKS \u201cTesting is another bottleneck. All buyers demand certifications but accredited laboratories do not exist in this country. This forces exporters to send samples overseas for testing, which is costly. We urge the government to subsidise part of this expense to relieve the burden on exporters,\u201d he states. Infrastructure gaps are equally pressing. \u201cWe need free trade zones with centralised water treatment plants. Each rubber factory cannot afford its own purification system,\u201d Rajapaksa muses. He continues: \u201cAnother obstacle is that Sri Lanka\u2019s FTAs have been poorly negotiated, making quality certification a barrier to trade. Despite the free trade agreements, some countries accept only their own national standards certification, not even European or American standards.\u201d The result, he points out, is that Sri Lanka hasn\u2019t been able to expand exports to such markets. Rajapaksa also highlights the new rules on export proceeds: \u201cThe government now enforces the rule that all export earnings must be brought back within 180 days. That\u2019s a positive move but additional incentives \u2013 such as tax benefits \u2013 could make it more attractive.\u201d And he recalls the convertible rupee account (CRA) system from decades ago: \u201cThe moment foreign exchange was brought in under this account, exporters received a three percent incentive and goods could also be imported. It was well-received by exporters.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, no such incentive exists today, which deters some exporters from repatriating their earnings,\u201d he says. On the other hand, he believes that the digitalisation of customs processes has been a rare success in the export chain. SHORTAGES The industry is also facing a shortage of skilled engineers and technicians. He warns that \u201cwith new taxes biting into middle-class incomes, many professionals are migrating. That\u2019s a huge cost, which the nation can ill afford.\u201d Rajapaksa calls for tax reforms and private universities to retain talent within the country. \u201cOtherwise, our best people \u2013 the ones capable of modernising the industry \u2013 will be gone,\u201d he cautions. Labour regulations concerning night shifts for female workers also need to be updated. \u201cWe must make it easier for women to participate in the workforce,\u201d he adds. REVIVAL Despite the headwinds, exporters continue to uphold global sustainability standards, ensuring there is no child labour while complying with health, social security and environmental parameters. In this regard, Sri Lanka clearly comes out on top. He says: \u201cMost buyers in the industry are demanding the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification \u2013 and some local estates have already earned the certification to remain competitive.\u201d Yet, he worries that \u201cSri Lanka is moving too slowly to comply with the EU\u2019s new deforestation rules. Government action has been slow \u2013 and without certification, buyers simply won\u2019t purchase our products.\u201d Port congestion and shipping delays also undermine Sri Lanka\u2019s aspirations to be a logistics hub. As Rajapaksa notes, \u201ca few months ago, the port faced severe congestion, causing shipping lines to bypass Colombo. Freight costs also remain high. Efficiency must improve and sudden strikes should be avoided \u2013 otherwise, Sri Lanka can never be positioned as a logistics hub.\u201d His prescription for reviving the industry is clear: \u201cWe must replant natural rubber \u2013 now. A clear national plan is needed, including incentives to support smallholders during the seven year gestation period. Without raw materials, there\u2019s no industry.\u201d \u201cAlthough the government recommends local procurement, it hasn\u2019t been made mandatory, which exposes local manufacturers vulnerable to cheaper imports,\u201d he observes. But despite the obstacles, Rajapaksa is confident that the rubber industry can recover if policy consistency...", "content_hash": "c24b3225e28b870cd0826dbbb44ec8d1", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:37.000846", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:37.000854", "update_count": 0}, "252": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "FINANCE PROFESSION", "url": "https://lmd.lk/finance-profession-dec-2025/", "text": "Q: In a volatile economic environment, what approaches to budgeting help businesses stay flexible yet disciplined? A: In uncertain and rapidly changing economic conditions, businesses must adopt budgeting methods that combine flexibility with financial discipline. The goal is to remain responsive to market shifts while maintaining control over spending and strategic alignment. Effective approaches include rolling forecasts, which are continuously updated to reflect current realities; scenario planning, which uses \u2018what if?\u2019 models to guide proactive decisions; and selective zero based budgeting, where each expense is justified to ensure every cost adds value. Additionally, driver based budgeting links financial plans to key operational drivers for faster responses to change while activity based budgeting allocates resources to activities that directly support strategic goals. Effective budgeting also relies on real-time data tracking, cross functional budget reviews and a data driven culture. Tools such as cash flow dashboards and variance analysis enable evidence based adjustments to sustain performance. By combining structured financial planning with flexibility, adaptive budgeting helps organisations stay disciplined yet nimble, positioning them to thrive amid volatility. Q: Do you believe traditional static budgets are becoming obsolete in today\u2019s business landscape? A: Traditional static budgets are not obsolete but they\u2019re increasingly inadequate in today\u2019s rapidly changing business environment. As volatility, digital disruption and real-time data reshape decision making, companies are shifting towards dynamic and continuous planning models. Static budgets lose relevance because they lock in assumptions for long periods \u2013 often 12 months or more \u2013 while market factors can shift within weeks. They\u2019re also slow to be updated and prone to budget gaming, where departments inflate requests or delay spending, leading to inefficiency and misalignment. While static budgets still promote financial discipline, accountability and regulatory compliance, emerging alternatives \u2013 such as scenario planning, driver based models and agile performance management \u2013 offer greater flexibility. Rather than being replaced, static budgets are now one part of a broader, dynamic financial planning ecosystem, providing long-term direction supported by systems that adapt to changing realities. Q: How has the role of internal audit (IA) evolved from being compliance driven to a strategic business partner? A: The transformation of IA from a compliance function to a strategic business partner marks a major shift in corporate governance \u2013 this is being driven by evolving risks, stakeholder expectations and technology. Traditionally, IA focussed on verifying compliance and internal controls through a checklist driven approach, which is essential but reactive, identifying errors rather than preventing them. Today, a volatile risk environment, digital transformation and growing strategic complexity have redefined IA\u2019s role. It has evolved into a trusted advisor aligned with business strategy, addressing emerging risks, providing forward-looking insights and strengthening governance. The next generation of internal audit will use AI driven risk analytics, deliver real-time assurance, and serve as a strategic intelligence hub connecting governance, performance and innovation. Evolving from policing compliance to enabling performance with assurance, IA now balances independence with strategic influence. Q: What financial indicators should business leaders focus on to make informed strategic decisions? A: In today\u2019s volatile business environment, financial insight has become a true competitive advantage. Paying close attention to financial indicators enables better informed decision making. Modern business leaders must look beyond traditional accounting metrics, and adopt a balanced set of indicators that link strategy, performance and value creation. The best strategic financial leaders integrate profitability, liquidity, efficiency and risk indicators, to guide adaptive, data dri\u00adven decisions. In uncertain markets, agility and insight \u2013 not merely control \u2013 determine resilience. To use these tools effectively, leaders should align KPIs with strategy, leverage real-time dashboards, benchmark performance and run scenario analyses to stay ahead of change. Q: How can the success of women in BPO and accountancy services contribute to economic empowerment? A: The growing participation and success of women in BPO and accounting roles are powerful drivers of Sri Lanka\u2019s economic and social transformation. These sectors not only promote gender equality but also enhance national competitiveness and resilience. The inclusion of women in structured skill based sectors such as BPO and accounting expands the workforce, boosts productivity and contributes directly to GDP growth. As export oriented industries, IT-BPM and financial services benefit from diverse talent, strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s position as a reliable and inclusive outsourcing hub while increasing forex earnings. This expansion of BPO and accounting operations to secondary cities \u2013 along with the rise of remote work \u2013 creates valuable opportunities for women beyond Colombo, encouraging regional growth and reducing urban migration. Women\u2019s income also generates powerful social benefits, empowering households, improving education and health outcomes, and challenging traditional gender norms. Moreover, greater female participation in finance and accountancy strengthens governance, transparency, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, increasing investor confidence and institutional credibility. Ultimately, these sectors support Sri Lanka\u2019s Digital Economy 2030 vision by driving highly skilled inclusive and sus\u00adtaina\u00adble growth. The rise of women in BPO and accountancy isn\u2019t only social progress; it\u2019s an economic strategy that expands exports, strengthens governance, and builds a more inclusive and competitive economy.", "content_hash": "981736b0c1daee437d0507185e623be2", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:39.504633", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:39.504656", "update_count": 0}, "253": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "BANKING SECTOR", "url": "https://lmd.lk/banking-sector-dec-2025/", "text": " Q: How do you assess the current state of women\u2019s representation in corporate boardrooms? A: Although the picture is more encouraging than it was several years ago, more needs to be done. Women hold only 13.4 percent of board seats in Sri Lanka \u2013 a figure that remains low when compared to global benchmarks, and even regional peers such as Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. While it is vital to accelerate diversity at board level, appointments must be based on merit rather than tokenism. In some organisations, legacy structures continue to hinder the advancement of women into leadership roles. Moreover, despite high female literacy rates, women\u2019s workforce participation remains notably lower than that of males, which impacts the leadership pipeline. Q: What practical steps should boards and regulators take to accelerate gender diversity at the top? A: Boards and regulators can act as catalysts for change by setting the tone at the top. Introducing voluntary targets or quotas helps create accountability while mandating disclosure on gender representation makes progress measurable and transparent. Beyond policy, boards must actively foster inclusive cultures by reviewing internal frameworks to accommodate flexible work arrangements, particularly for mid-career women. Unconscious bias in recruitment, promotions and evaluations must also be systematically addressed. Equally important is the development of robust talent pipelines through coaching, mentoring and sponsorship. Structured accelerator programmes and succession planning that deliberately include female talent ensure sustaina\u00adbility. Tools such as curated directories of female professionals with board potential, along with closer collaboration with regulators to strengthen gender provisions in corporate governance frameworks, can help move the country from conversation to action. Q: How do you see emotional intelligence (EI) shaping workplace culture and leadership effectiveness in the banking sector? A: Emotional Intelligence has become a defining trait of successful leadership, particularly in banking, where trust, relationships and service underpin operations. Leaders with strong EI demonstrate self-awareness and empathy, enabling them to respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively in high-pressure situations. At an organisational level, emotional intelligence drives effective communication, reduces misunderstandings, and builds a culture of respect and engagement. In a sector often associated with stress and long hours, EI also plays a key role in reducing burnout and strengthening resilience \u2013 traits that are essential for building sustainable workplace cultures. Q: What are the most pressing operational challenges faced by banks today? A: Operational challenges continue to revolve around balancing modernisation with resource constraints. Many banks still grapple with outdated legacy systems, which complicates the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. Integration is both costly and resource intensive, limiting the ability to scale digital solutions across all functions. Cybersecurity has emerged as another major challenge with threats growing more complex, placing pressure on banks to continually upgrade their defences. Simultaneously, customer expectations are rapidly evolving, shaped by global digital first experiences. Q: How do you view digital transformation reshaping back office operations in the next five years? A: Back office functions are undergoing a fundamental shift from being cost centres to value creators. Over the next five years, automation powered by AI and robotic process automation (RPA) will handle repetitive tasks such as reconciliations, compliance checks and routine reporting. However, true digital transformation also requires investing in people. Upskilling and reskilling initiatives coupled with continuous learning ecosystems will be critical. Inclusive training programmes must ensure that employees at all levels remain relevant and confident about adopting new tools, embedding innovation into the organisation\u2019s DNA. Q: What lessons can banks learn from global best practices in risk and controls? A: The global banking sector highlights the importance of a holistic and proactive approach to risk. Clear governance structures, well-defined risk appetite statements and transparent reporting lines are non-negotiable. Risk identification must evolve from a periodic exercise to a continuous organisation wide practice supported by scenario analysis and stress testing. Controls should be seamlessly embedded into daily operations rather than be treated as afterthoughts with technology leveraged to enhance efficiency. A strong risk culture \u2013 driven by tone at the top, reinforced by regular training and supported by clear communication \u2013 ensures that accountability is shared across the organisation rather than siloed within compliance functions. Q: And what leadership qualities are most critical for future banking executives, in your view? A: The banking sector operates in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment, making leadership qualities more critical than ever. Future leaders must demonstrate agility and foresight to anticipate change, as well as adaptability to respond effectively to disruption. Technical knowledge in areas such as digital transformation, cybersecurity and regulatory compliance must be balanced with people centric skills \u2013 for example, emotional intelligence, collaboration and relationship management. Ethical integrity and accountability remain essential for maintaining trust in an industry built on confidence. Leaders must also embrace continuous learning, innovation and inclusivity, creating diverse teams that produce well-rounded solutions. The most effective leaders will combine strategic vision with empathy, guiding organisations through transformation while keeping people at the centre.", "content_hash": "b31fbe862f1087a36a85ac6fb18d5338", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:43.503922", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:43.503930", "update_count": 0}, "254": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "FINANCIAL SERVICES", "url": "https://lmd.lk/financial-services-dec-2025/", "text": "Key marketing shifts in the banking sector Marketing in the banking sector has moved from selling products to creating experience driven ecosystems built on convenience, trust and data powered personalisation. Evolving customer behaviours in financial services They are more informed, mobile first and purpose driven, expecting seamless digital experiences and genuine value driven engagement beyond transactions. Role of personalisation in driving customer loyalty Personalisation is loyalty; it builds emotional connections by anticipating customer needs and positions a brand as a trusted financial partner. Data driven decision making in shaping marketing strategies Data has redefined the marketing playbook; it provides the power to predict, not merely react, turning creativity into measurable strategy and intuition into intelligence. Factors influencing customer trust in choosing financial services Trust is built on transparency, security and consistent performance \u2013 especially in how responsibly a brand manages customer data. Balance between traditional and digital marketing Digital will clearly dominate but traditional marketing still humanises brands \u2013 the future lies in a \u2018phygital\u2019balance, blending digital precision with human emotion. Three priorities for financial services marketers It\u2019s about driving data based personalisation, crafting seamless omni channel experiences and nurturing emotional connections that go beyond products. Impact of fintechs on marketing strategies Fintechs have been a positive disruption, driving banks to be more agile, customer centric, and innovative with faster, leaner and more digital marketing strategies. Role of brand positioning in differentiating financial institutions Brand positioning is crucial; it differentiates institutions through a clear purpose and voice grounded in innovation and empowerment, beyond easily replicated products. Understanding the needs of Gen Z customers Marketers must deliver authentic purpose driven storytelling, and fast and meaningful digital experiences that foster genuine connection to engage Gen Z. Digital marketing channels that deliver the highest ROI Social media, content marketing and search continue to deliver great ROI. Yet, the real power comes when data connects these channels into one intelligent ecosystem. Impact of social media on customer engagement Social media has made banking conversational. It is no longer about broadcasting; it\u2019s about listening, engaging and building communities in real time. Role of content marketing in driving customer acquisition Content is the new credibility; thoughtful, value driven content positions a brand as a trusted advisor long before the customer makes a decision. Effectiveness of influencer marketing If it is pursued authentically, it\u2019s quite effective \u2013 the key is partnering with credible voices that educate and inspire trust, not merely promote. Impactful marketing automation tools AI driven CRM systems, predictive analytics and marketing automation tools that deliver truly personalised experiences are game changers. Importance of video marketing in creating brand connections Extremely important \u2013 video bridges the emotional gap between data and people; it simplifies complex ideas and creates deeper human connections. AI powered personalisation in campaigns Artificial intelligence is the future, enabling campaigns that intuitively tailor experiences to each individual\u2019s behaviour. How critical is SEO and content optimisation for digital visibility It is vital: SEO drives discoverability while great content keeps audiences engaged. Mobile first strategies in reaching younger audiences This is the new bank branch; mobile first strategies are essential, as today\u2019s customers discover, decide and engage primarily through their devices. Future of omni channel marketing This will evolve into omni experiencemarketing where every channel is connected, predictive and emotionally intelligent with the customer not even realising the transition between channels. Challenges marketers face Balancing automation with authenticity \u2013 we must ensure technology enhances, not replaces, the human connection at the heart of marketing. Retaining customers in a competitive market Customer retention hinges on consistently delivering value, and making customers feel genuinely understood and empowered.

The government\u2019s second budget since taking office a year ago took a broad-based multi-sectoral approach by balancing fiscal discipline with targeted social measures. In many ways, it signalled a transition from crisis recovery to consolidation. Yet as always, implementation remains the ultimate test. FISCAL STRENGTH Sri Lanka\u2019s fiscal turnaround in only three years has been remarkable. In 2022, revenue collapsed to around eight percent of GDP \u2013 among the lowest in Asia. By the end of 2025, the government expects revenue to be close to 16 percent of gross domestic product, which is the highest since 2007. The primary surplus, projected at 2.3 percent of GDP, is now forecast to reach 3.8 percent in this year, surpassing targets under the IMF programme. This overperformance reflects both the steep tax adjustments introduced since 2022 and one-off revenue effects from pent-up demand \u2013 particularly after import restrictions on vehicles and other consumer goods were lifted. But the government rightly recognises that such buoyancy is temporary: the budget projections for 2026 have been revised downwards modestly, anticipating a slowdown in consumption and import related revenue. Even so, the numbers remain above IMF forecasts, suggesting that fiscal stability is firmly entrenched. DIGITALISATION Budget 2026 also underscored the government\u2019s commitment to accelerating digital transformation, and positioning it as a key enabler of public sector efficiency and private sector competitiveness. An e-procurement system is to be introduced shortly to digitise and streamline public procurement processes by enhancing transparency and accountability. By March next year, people will be able to submit their asset declarations digitally, marking another step in governance reform. In parallel, the budget identified a potential US$ 15 billion growth opportunity in the digital economy that\u2019s underpinned by expanding infrastructure and technology adoption. The establishment of two new IT zones in Digana and Nuwara Eliya under the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), along with the issuance of digital IDs in 2026, signals intent to build a connected and innovation driven economy. Together, these initiatives have the potential to modernise service delivery, attract tech investments and expand digital inclusion across sectors. REFORM MOMENTUM One of the budget\u2019s more encouraging proposals is its alignment with the structural reform agenda that has reinforced Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery. It references progress on several long pending measures such as the execution of the National Tariff Policy, establishment of the Trade National Single Window (TNSW) and implementation of the PPP (public-private partnership) Framework. Equally significant is the recognition of land management and investment access as binding constraints. The inclusion of the National Land Use Plan and establishment of a digital land registry are direct responses to longstanding private sector concerns. If executed effectively, these measures could unlock investment bottlenecks that have slowed project approvals and land allocation for years. CAPITAL AND SMEs A welcome development is the reduction of the investment threshold for enhanced capital allowances from US$ 3 million to 250,000 dollars. This change will allow more SMEs and mid-size investors to benefit from existing incentives by encouraging reinvestment and technology upgrading at a company level. At the same time, the government has proposed a new residence visa scheme for foreign investors who meet certain thresholds in priority sectors \u2013 a pragmatic step to improve investor confidence and the ease of doing business. However, what\u2019s missing from the budget is a comprehensive investment incentive package linked to the proposed revisions in the Strategic Development Act. Such a framework could have clarified the future direction of investment policy and strengthened Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness relative to its regional peers. WORLD TRADE Amid global trade realignments, Sri Lanka stands at a strategic crossroads. Supply chain diversification across Asia is accelerating, and countries in South and Southeast Asia are vying for investments due to geographical risk diversification. The budget could have articulated how Sri Lanka intends to capture this opportunity. While the new tariff bands and trade facilitation commitments are positives, investors will look for clarity on the broader economic transformation agenda \u2013 including reforms to institutions such as the BOI under the Economic Transformation Act. Faster movement on these institutional reforms will determine whether Sri Lanka remains merely stable or becomes genuinely competitive as a supply chain partner and export platform. DELIVERY IS KEY For 2026, the message is clear: execution must outpace promises. In parallel, growth must be inclusive. As the economy shifts from consumption to investment led growth, targeted social and poverty alleviation programmes will be needed to protect vulnerable communities, and ensure a broad-based recovery. If 2025 was the year of enhancing economic stability, 2026 should be the year of executing reforms \u2013 swiftly, consistently and with accountability. That\u2019s the only path to converting fiscal strength into sustained, inclusive and transformative growth.", "content_hash": "5f2f5073a6658d09bbc01eb2bb01f96b", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:48.247843", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:48.247852", "update_count": 0}, "256": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "THE GREEN ECONOMY", "url": "https://lmd.lk/the-green-economy-dec-2025/", "text": "Moving towards a green economy presents both opportunities and challenges. A green economy is characterised by low carbon activities compared to fossil fuel driven economic activities. This shift to producing cleaner goods and services is vital for businesses \u2013 and indeed, the planet. Professional services network Deloitte estimates that 43 percent of the workforce in the Asia-Pacific region is employed in industries and sectors that are vulnerable to climate impacts or transitioning to a low carbon economy. This vulnerability needs to be addressed by greening human resource planning, and developing a strategy that cuts across all sectors and industries. Such a green transition will need to shift from brown jobs in environmentally intensive activities to cleaner green alternatives. And the redistributive impact on jobs is extensive. It requires vision, a 360 degree perspective across sectors and industries, and courage if it is to benefit many through the myriad opportunities associated with a green economy. It also calls for human resource planning, intensifying green vocational training and reallocating labour using market based incentives that reinforce this transition. Growth sectors in a green transition include renewable energy and low pollution industries that will grow new jobs to compensate for losses in polluting ones. Therefore, education, training, skills development and retraining are needed, to ensure adaptability and inclusivity in the new economy. The World Bank defines green jobs in three ways: what businesses produce \u2013 jobs in environmentally-friendly goods and services; how they produce \u2013 using eco-friendly production processes, technologies and inputs; and what workers do \u2013 applying green skills to perform tasks such as environmentally-friendly waste disposal in manufacturing. Sustainability can help define green jobs and different types of work can be made more sustainable \u2013 e.g. bakers using organic flour, sustainable packaging and energy efficient ovens. Employers can incorporate sustainable practices by reskilling the workforce and inculcating a sustainability mindset. There are also green industries with green jobs. The green industry definition examines outputs and identifies green economic activities by using a green taxonomy. China, the EU, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have developed their own taxono\u00admies, and will use them to analyse green job trends in the future. At the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28), Sri Lanka estimated that it would need US$ 100 billion in investments to achieve net zero or four billion dollars annually from now until 2050, or five percent of its GDP in 2022. The Green Finance Taxonomy issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in 2022 aims to guide investments towards green economic activities that are needed to realise the country\u2019s transition to an inclusive and cleaner economy. Financial institutions are required to report on credit in these categories to track green investments and in time, this tool could be used to track green jobs. Sri Lanka\u2019s green jobs will also help open up sustainability oriented export markets, particularly in the EU. These jobs will also have to be integrated into plans for critical export diversification \u2013 especially the value added sphere. The National Export Development Plan (NEDP) 2025-29, which is being formulated, will have to include this eventuality in priority sectors at least. Sustainable finance initiatives are increasing in Sri Lanka, and they will be vital for creating green jobs and generating cleaner economic growth. The Central Bank\u2019s Sustainable Finance Roadmap 2.0 for the period between 2025 and 2029 addresses both environmental aspects (climate change, natural assets and biodiversity) and social themes such as inclusiveness; micro, small and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs); vulnerable groups; and gender. Priority areas include climate change mitigation and adaptation, forests and other critical assets, and inclusiveness, all of which have great potential for green jobs. Since the country\u2019s unemployment rate is high among youth and young graduates compared to the wider world, this is an important area for policy making. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicts that technical and medium skill occupations will be in high demand during the green transition. The job groups with high demand are building and related trade workers, elementary level labour in manufacturing, construction and transport, and skilled agricultural workers. Employment trends aren\u2019t expected to be linear. Technically skilled workers will include wind turbine service technicians, environmental engineers, soil and plant scientists, electric vehicle (EV) technicians and others who will service the green transition. Since green jobs require more technical skills and a sustainability mindset, it\u2019s necessary to teach the latter across all education subsectors including vocational training. The government must incorporate this type of thinking in its current educational reforms. Sri Lanka must ensure policy consistency so that it too can transition efficiently.", "content_hash": "e0b1696660d2e02b2a69be335082eeb8", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:50.427161", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:50.427168", "update_count": 0}, "257": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "SME SECTOR", "url": "https://lmd.lk/sme-sector-dec-2025/", "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s SME sector is the backbone of the economy; it accounts for over 75 percent of all active enterprises, 45 percent of national employment and 52 percent of GDP. Small and medium-size enterprises drive inclusive economic growth, regional development and poverty reduction, and are crucial for agriculture, manufacturing, services and IT. However, these entities face extensive challenges including access to finance, managing raw material supply, and navigating the impacts of global and national economic crises. SMEs play a pivotal role in maintaining the economic fabric of this country by contributing substantially to employment, GDP and social stability. However, they are presently finding it difficult to access finance due to bank refusals, higher corporate tax rates, the volatile economic recovery and supply chaindisruptions that impact operations. These enterprises are also struggling due to a lack of skilled specialists, high operating costs, cash flow restrictions, shirking customer bases, and the need to adapt to digital transformation and cost cutting measures to survive the aftermath of the economic crisis, as well as evolving market demands. The media recently reported that the banking sector as a whole made a Rs. 48 billion dividend payout, which adds pressure on the overall management of this issue. Furthermore, the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development has been tasked with managing this challenge; and unless it addresses the problems faced by SMEs urgently, there will be an adverse impact on industrial and commercial performance. The SME sector generates more than 50 percent of state revenue through tourism, exports and so on. While there is considerable visibility of the formal sector in the print and electronic media, we rarely see SMEs highlighted in magazines or the finance, economy and business sections of newspapers. They\u2019re often lost in the industrial and commercial space \u2013 so much so that some even brand SMEs as the \u2018forgotten sector.\u2019 When the numbers are crunched, it is apparent that small and medium-size enterprises contribute a colossal 35 billion dollars to the economy, according to current statistics. So it is indeed the forgotten sector of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy simply because its constituents\u2019 voices cannot be heard over the noise of the larger industries and sectors. In the recent past nevertheless, the SME sector has been seen and heard in the media with far more time being allocated to its members to discuss their aspirations, goals and achievements. Therefore, a new policy perspective of the government coming into play is imperative. However, it\u2019s difficult to be overly excited about the latest developments since we\u2019ve heard such rhetoric many times in the past, following the SME white paper of 2002, which outlined a national strategy for its development and was presented to the public. As with some other good intentions unfortunately, we haven\u2019t heard much about it since then. The SME sector began evolving in Sri Lanka back in 1952 when the World Bank suggested that the government works towards developing small and medium-size enterprises rather than spending its time promoting large industries. According to the Export Development Board (EDB) and Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the best way forward is for the government to allocate a single line ministry for this particular area of business. This will lead to a clear and focussed agenda that\u2019ll be followed by a set of policy guidelines. If this is done, some of the key issues will be addressed due to its targeted implementation. Perhaps the Regional Development Bank (RDB) could establish a unit that helps SMEs structure their documentation in a way that enables easier access to finance even if the cost of such capital isn\u2019t as attractive. The logic is that even if interest rates are reduced to levels that are quite attractive, SMEs need to practice strict financial discipline if they wish to access finance easily. Finally, the government will need to fast track the setting up of industrial estates in various parts of the country in an industry specific manner as in India so that there is greater focus and stronger networking, which will lead to such indus\u00adtries or sectors becoming competitive. This will also help drive specific technology that can be shared by diverse competitors, according to export promotion and tourism development authorities. Strengthening the SME sector is key to maintaining Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth momentum. And it\u2019s vital that the banking sector extends its fullest support to the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development so that this crucial sector can be developed. And the manner in which policies are implemented will be the acid test for the government. Indeed, the need of the hour is to strengthen small and medium-size enterprises.", "content_hash": "6d3106e7d4ba85ecaf1c439952ae0bed", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:52.481245", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:52.481254", "update_count": 0}, "258": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "ECONOMIC OUTLOOK", "url": "https://lmd.lk/economic-outlook-nov-2025/", "text": " Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is once again showing signs of resilience. In the second quarter of 2025, GDP expanded by 4.9 percent year on year and marked the eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Such consistency hadn\u2019t been seen since the 2016/17 period, underscoring a shift from mere stabilisation to a more decisive recovery. The question now is whether this momentum can be transformed into a period of sustained and accelerated growth \u2013 and as such, it\u2019s necessary to examine the latest GDP numbers and consider what they tell us about the country\u2019s economic trajectory. STRONGER PULSE Following two quarters of contraction, the agriculture sector recorded growth in the April-June period with output rising by two percent, compared to a contraction of 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year and 2.2 percent in the last quarter of 2024. Agriculture provided much of the lift, supported by strong harvests in rice, fruits and animal husbandry. However, weaknesses remained in spices and fishing. Following an extended run, the industry sector cooled modestly \u2013 manufacturing contracted slightly as businesses grappled with tariff and trade uncertainties. Yet, this was countered by renewed activity in mining and construction, which signalled investment and infrastructure related work regaining traction. The Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for Construction continues to remain positive and with the resumption of retail construction, this subsector has room to grow further and recover to pre-pandemic levels. Services, which form the bedrock of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, accelerated at its fastest pace since the last quarter of 2021. Tourism, which mirrored 2018 pre-crisis levels, powered growth in transport, warehousing and hospitality. In the meantime, the rebound in construction boosted real estate and related services, while even public administration and defence showed renewed activity after earlier contractions. Wholesale and retail trade improved but still lag behind their long-term average. The other aspect of GDP is to consider it in the context of expenditure, where it\u2019s evident that household consumption averages 60-70 percent of gross domestic product. Weak spending by consumers is a drag on economic growth. However, since last year\u2019s second quarter, household consumption has been consistently positive and one and half to twice the GDP growth witnessed in previous quarters. This signals that consumers are recovering from the crisis and looking to spend more than they did in the past. EXTERNAL DRIVERS Exports, tourism and worker remittances continue to anchor the recovery. Exports of goods were up six percent in the first half of this year, remittances have averaged US$ 650 million a month (which is well above pre-pandemic levels) and tourist arrivals rival the country\u2019s best ever year of 2018. Even lagging sectors such as construction, private investment and credit markets are showing signs of revival with private sector credit growing 20 percent year on year in July. Much of this credit is towards the import of vehicles but the real estate sector is also borrowing heavily. The most encouraging yardstick is the inflow of worker remittances, which rose almost 20 percent during first eight months of 2025 and is on track to achieve its highest level ever. Recent skilled migration and demand from nontraditional high paying markets are key drivers of this growth. US tariffs have also underscored this resilience. Initially imposed with a punishing 44 percent reciprocal tariff in April, Sri Lanka saw a 90 day pause before the United States imposed a 20 percent tariff in August. Crucially, this rate is largely aligned with competitors such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan. As a result, Sri Lanka\u2019s relative export competitiveness remains intact. However, Sri Lanka can\u2019t afford to rest on its laurels with the 5.9 percent growth it has seen in exports. While much of this could be due to inven\u00adtory buildup in countries such as the US, nations such as Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines saw their exports grow between 13 and 15 percent in the first half of 2025. This highlights both the lack of market and product diversification of Sri Lanka\u2019s export basket relative to a country such as Thailand, which is seeing more demand for EV components and processed food. WHAT LIES AHEAD Though manufacturing is vulnerable to external shocks, agriculture is uneven across subsectors and domestic demand still lags in some areas, the persistence of growth is an encouraging sign. With exports, worker remittances and tourism performing strongly, and construction and credit showing renewed energy, the economy is moving towards a more balanced footing. The forthcoming Budget 2026 should help promote more growth and sustain Sri Lanka\u2019s reform path, by unlocking barriers to land, labour and capital. Spurring investment led export growth through private sector investment zones and digital led productivity incentives are also avenues for expansion. If policies remains consistent and the investment climate improves alongside ongoing structural reforms, Sri Lanka may well sustain this momentum beyond 2025. In an era of global uncertainty, that would be no small achievement.", "content_hash": "7fa4eff70d1bf7251b7cfb88543e5122", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:56.096553", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:52:56.096573", "update_count": 0}, "259": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "THE AI ECONOMY", "url": "https://lmd.lk/the-ai-economy-dec-2025/", "text": "Once a sideshow of computer science, AI has become the main act of the global economy today. What began as a clever experiment in pattern recognition has matured into the core infrastructure of production, power and politics. And it has shifted from research labs to boardrooms, data centres and government agendas, to quietly redefine decision making. Three forces explain why this disruption differs from past industrial revolutions. First, artificial intelligence has transformed the economics of cognitive labour. Generative and analytical models can write, summarise and interpret complex information in seconds. Where teams of analysts once spent days producing reports, a single person armed with an algorithm can now do the same work before lunch. Second, AI\u2019s supply chain is consolidating around a few critical chokepoints. Control over advanced chips, hyperscale computing infrastructure and model training pipelines grant a handful of enterprises near monopolistic power. These nodes of computation and data produce potent network effects where the more users they attract, the smarter their systems become. And as with previous technological platforms, the spoils are going not to the many but a few. Third, governments have moved from passive curiosity to active intervention. Regulators in the US, Europe and Asia are racing to write the rules of algorithmic engagement. What began as loose guidelines for safety and ethics have hardened into legislation covering transparency, accountability and data sovereignty. PARADIGM SHIFT Together, these forces have transformed AI from a scientific breakthrough into an instrument of economic and geopolitical reordering. This transformation is clearer in industries that are being rebuilt from within. In biotechno\u00adlogy, AI models such as AlphaFold 3 have revolutionised molecular biology by predicting protein structures and designing drug candidates in weeks rather than years. Painstaking research of the past is now proceeding at digital speed and attracting investment to AI driven discovery platforms that fuse biology with computation. Finance is following suit. Banks and insurers use artificial intelligence to detect fraud, underwrite policies and manage risk, often with greater accuracy than humans. Retailers deploy algorithms to generate personalised recommendations and market content at minimal cost. And logistics firms are using predictive maintenance, route optimisation and autonomous delivery systems to cut inefficiency from global supply chains. In each case, the pattern is the same: task level automation, restructured workflows and the rise of competitors that marry domain knowledge with algorithmic scale. However, the impact on labour is more complex. Routine cognitive work such as scheduling, data entry and reporting is rapidly vanishing. Yet, creative, ethical and strategic roles are being augmented rather than replaced. The result is a polarised labour market where demand is surging for people who can train, govern and integrate AI systems while mid-skill administrative roles are declining. WORKSLOP ISSUES Nations that invest in digital reskilling, portable credentials and fair transition policies will spread the benefits more widely. Those that fail to do so risk turning a technological revolution into a social fissure. AI\u2019s rise offers extraordinary potential but brings subtler \u2013 often overlooked \u2013 hazards. Scholars warn of \u2018workslop\u2019 where streams of machine generated text and imagery add little real value. Such output can cloud decision making, lower standards, create the illusion of productivity and show that efficiency without judgement can be counterproductive. The advantages for businesses lie not in indiscriminate automation but targeted, carefully governed application of artificial intelligence to tasks where measurable gains are clear. In this new landscape, leadership depends less on speed than the trust, judgement and ethical oversight that guide deployment, and makes discernment itself a rare and competitive asset. DIGITAL VELOCITY AI has also become an instrument of statecraft. The EU\u2019s laws, the US\u2019 semiconductor initiatives and Asia\u2019s colossal data infrastructure investments are shaping where the value of this new intelligence economy is accruing. Countries that blend scientific excellence with predictable regulation and adaptable workforce policies will dominate the next phase of global innovation. In this new order, chips, data and algorithms are the raw materials of power. AI is an industrial revolution that\u2019s unfolding at digital velocity by compressing timelines, concentrating influence and testing society\u2019s ability to adapt. Those who treat it as a passing phase will find themselves outpaced and outflanked by others who see it as a new operating system for civilisation.

So what is this marketing funnel? It\u2019s a linear, predetermined path that leads people from awareness through interest and a desire to action. The goal is to draw attention, build curiosity, stir emotion and convince customers to make a purchase. This method worked well for a long time. Whether it was shopping online or offline, marketers looked at the marketing funnel as a straightforward sequence of steps. However, it seems that those days are over \u2013 because Generation Z is refusing to play along. Due to their need for instant gratification, short attention spans, endless scrolling, feeds and meme loving ways, the old funnel is cracking. Gen Zs are proving that it was built for the old world, not one that has radically different priorities, influences and technology. The path to purchase has blurred because their primary general marketplace \u2013 i.e. social media \u2013 is also where they post life updates, laugh, learn, argue and pass the time. With purchasing tangled up with everything else now, it is no longer a straight path\u2026 it\u2019s an infinite loop of inspiration, exploration, community and loyalty. And the brands that stick are those that get this mix right. INSPIRATION To understand how Gen Z decides, it\u2019s important to start with their constant state of inspiration. In other words, it\u2019s about understanding how social media acts as their main source of inspiration. From fashion and beauty to recipes and lifestyles, inspiration is gathered using their devices. With so much content in the digital space however, marketers are faced with the challenge of attracting their attention and showing up in the right way at the right moment. Influencers, creators and cele\u00adbrities still play a major role in this process. To be honest, their influence is easy to spot; because with one post or concept, a new aesthetic is born before a product can hit the shelves. And these trends don\u2019t simply appear; they multiply through algorithms by blending culture and commerce as they reshape marketing. EXPLORATION As social media becomes important to the inspiration phase, these platforms assume the next logical step, which is instant gratification and impulse buying \u2013 see it, like it, buy it! This phase is also seeing almost all social media platforms rolling out \u2018in app\u2019 shopping features to facilitate smoother customer experiences. However, this is producing mixed results because Gen Zs aren\u2019t really engaging in impulse buying. They\u2019re investigating and exploring on social media, and seeking details from reviews on quality and more \u2013 and they want these now! They don\u2019t believe in a brand without undertaking their own research. So where do they conduct this research? Anywhere and everywhere online \u2013 including the comments section, which has become the new customer service desk. Brands can capitalise on this by explaining, demonstrating and engaging with reviews rather than simply promoting a product or service. The icing on the cake is that user generated content (UGC) shows how products really look and feel. COMMUNITY The brands that get it right don\u2019t simply sell things \u2013 they build communities. So how does this work? The secret to winning Gen Z shoppers is to make them feel like they belong. For most of them, their favourite brands are those that make them feel like part of a community. Gen Z is always buying into something rather than simply purchasing products. This process triggers loyalty towards the brand; and loyalty is about shared identity rather than repeat purchases. And Gen Z also expects brands to earn loyalty by continuous innovation, engagement and showing up. A brand has to think bigger than its product drops, and create an ecosystem of experiences, touchpoints and values. LOYALTY Previously, the idea of brand loyalty meant repeat purchases. However, Gen Zs expect more. They want rela\u00adtionships with brands to be two-sided and their measure of loyalty is though connection. While discounts and offers still matter, Gen Z expects brands to offer something real (whether it\u2019s an experience, a conversation or content) without asking for money first. And they want to see the brand grow, stretch and surprise them. UGC helps feed into this demand and brands can leverage it to let consumers see themselves in the bigger picture. The new dynamic is that people themselves are at the centre of the journey rather than the brands. And the path from awareness to purchase isn\u2019t linear anymore. It\u2019s a loop that never really ends \u2013 from inspiration to exploration, community and loyalty, and back again. Brands that understand this and build for it will win with Gen Z. Gen Z is always buying into something", "content_hash": "1cde4fa79482aaca1b7a63cca1dbc631", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:00.390315", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:00.390326", "update_count": 0}, "261": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP", "url": "https://lmd.lk/strategic-leadership-dec-2025/", "text": " Although leadership is increasingly associated with wealth, power, popularity and showmanship, there\u2019s more to it than these superficial indicators. In essence, it\u2019s the achievement of a goal through the direction of one\u2019s followers. If you can persuade your collaborators to achieve particular ends, you\u2019re a leader. And if you can accomplish this day after day and year after year, in various settings and circumstances, you\u2019re a great leader. In this context, a Harvard Business Review (HBR) article written by William Prentice titled Understanding Leadership notes that leaders may not necessarily possess or display power, or be popular. The author adds that their followers may never do what leaders wish out of love or admiration. What\u2019s more, they may not have colourful personalities or use memorable devices to dramatise the purpose of the group or focus attention on their leadership. A leader\u2019s unique achievement is human and social, which springs from understanding his or her fellow workers, and the relationships between their individual aims and the organisational goals that need to be accomplished. Before leaders can motivate their fellow workers to achieve a given goal, they must know why they do what they do. What really motivates them? Is it financial rewards or are they seeking recognition or validation? Or do they work where you do simply because they enjoy working there? Are they working to fund their lavish lifestyles or expensive hobbies, or hone their skills so they can embark on their own ventures? Are they working there because of the frequent parties and outings \u2013 or is it because of the relaxed and laid-back atmosphere? Or do they work for the organisation because its mission resonates with their personal values or ideals? The list of possible motivators could go on and on. But the bottom line isn\u2019t to oversimplify or generalise why people work \u2013 because it\u2019s rarely for financial rewards alone. As Prentice emphasises, \u201chuman beings aren\u2019t machines with a single set of push buttons. When their complex responses to love, prestige, independence, achievement and group membership are unrecognised on the job, they perform at best as automata who bring far less than their maximum efficiency\u2026 and at worst, as rebellious slaves who consciously or unconsciously sabotage the activities they are supposed to be furthering.\u201d Indeed, some leaders tend to believe in the effectiveness of the \u2018command and control\u2019 approach in leadership as seen in the military. But this is where \u2013 most of the time, if not always \u2013 we find the purest example of an unimaginative application of simple reward and punishment as the motivating devices. In defence of the military however, these two observations are noteworthy: soldiers are killed and have to be replaced, which is largely the basis for treating them uniformly and mechanically; and clarity about duties and responsibilities as practised by the auto\u00adcratic chain of command is absolutely essential to warfare. While the fairness of considering assembly line workers as being expendable is questionable, there\u2019s no doubt that the articulation of duties and responsibilities is a clear sign of an efficient organisation. But as a leader, you should know better than to mistake the autocratic chain of command or organisational chart to be the basis for getting things done. In reality, the organisational chart is nothing but a simplified diagram. Your role is to convince each person to fully understand his or her role in relation to the group effort, and then carry it out wholeheartedly. If you succeed as a leader, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve mastered two basic lessons: people are complex; and people are different. So when you assign responsibilities, and recognise and reward people, you should be profoundly aware of this complexity and the differences in play. Ideally, your organisation should have workers at every level reporting to people whose dominion is small enough to enable them to know those who report to them as human beings. The golden rule for all human relationships \u2013 which is to treat others as you wish to be treated \u2013 is applicable to leadership too\u2026 but within limits. Although it\u2019s oversimplified, this is a great improvement over the primitive coercive approaches or the straight \u2018reward for desired behaviour\u2019 approach. Prentice says all of us have known unselfish people who earnestly wished to satisfy the needs of their fellow beings but were remarkably incompetent as executives, or perhaps even as friends or spouses, because it never occurred to them that others had different emotional requirements. In essence, becoming an effective leader requires the adoption of a healthy mix of firmness and emotional intelligence.", "content_hash": "e90e68bcee2f0a76722bcfa035f8b588", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:02.705645", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:02.705658", "update_count": 0}, "262": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "SME DEVELOPMENT", "url": "https://lmd.lk/sme-development-dec-2025/", "text": " Economies everywhere are shaped by volatile geopolitics, shifting tariffs, technological upheavals, capital market tremors and sudden disruptions. SMEs form the backbone of most economies. Turbulence has been devastating for many of them in recent years and many have foregone available opportunities. The one factor that now separates resilience from ruin is change readiness. Large enterprises have buffers with easier access to capital, strong connections with regulators and lobbying power to swing policy in their favour. Small and medium-size enterprises operate on slimmer margins and with more constraints \u2013 and their survival depends on agility. Being change ready is an existential issue for them. Consider SMEs in Sri Lanka\u2019s apparel industry. When sustainability norms are made more stringent by global giants, the question of affordability arises for these enterprises. Change readiness to embrace eco-friendly dyes, digitalisation and transparent labour policies help some retain their existing buyers. Technology is transforming business faster than ever. SMEs find it useful but have to worry about cost-benefit optimisation. Digital platforms, mobile payment systems, AI driven analytics and so on are all viable methods to cut costs and ensure efficiency. During the pandemic, tea exporters who embraced e-commerce platforms managed to reach international customers directly by bypassing disrupted intermediaries. But it can be fatal for businesses that can\u2019t keep pace with tech advancements. A retailer who refused to adopt digital payments found itself out of business because customers preferred cashless convenience. Change readiness isn\u2019t about buying every new tool but rather, a willingness to integrate relevant technologies quickly and effectively. With increasing interconnectedness, SMEs must revisit their export strategies and learn about different consumer behaviour \u2013 whether it\u2019s spices in Europe or halal certified processed meat for the Middle East. It\u2019s essential to meet each market\u2019s demands for sustained business and change readiness is needed to transform mindsets from a local focus to a global outlook. A local spice exporter changed its packaging and certification processes to meet the halal standards of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC); and although it wasn\u2019t easy, this helped the exporter gain a foothold in that lucrative market. Without readiness to change, doors remain closed. From currency devaluations and fuel shortages due to COVID-19, and economic bankruptcy, Sri Lanka\u2019s SMEs have seen it all over the past few years. Resilience was essential in all such instances; and to this end, change ready businesses maintained cash reserves, diversified supply chains and built contingency plans. Change readiness includes strategies and people too. Enterprises that establish a culture of learning, upskilling and innovation build resilience, retain talent and stay competitive. In the ICT sector, entities that allowed young engineers to experiment with blockchain and AI are now exporting globally while others have lost their best talent. Another challenge is regulatory changes in tax policies, trade tariffs and compliance requirements. Businesses that embrace change readiness in policy monitoring, compliance and potential reforms will face crises well, and thrive in disruptions. Customer preferences shift quickly and loyalty can\u2019t be taken for granted. Enterprises must be nimble enough to face the changing expectations of stakeholders. SME\u2019s account for over half of Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP and employs millions of people. Their survival and growth are critical for building the nation; and their future can\u2019t be decided by subsidies or short-term incentives. Success will have to be led by how well they cultivate the muscle of change readiness. It\u2019s this mindset that transforms crises into opportunities, disruptions into breakthroughs and small businesses into resilient engines of national progress. Being change ready is no longer a competitive advantage; instead, it\u2019s critical for survival. SMEs in Sri Lanka can hardwire change readiness into their DNA by leading from the front because adaptive leaders inspire confidence in facing crisis and uncertainty. A flexible work policy makes working from anywhere a standard. This will attract talent, boost productivity and improve adaptability. Continuous learning will ensure that employees are future ready. And agile decision making enables employees to make quick, informed decisions with communication channels that are open to higher levels. Constructive partnerships with peers, associations and others enable resource sharing and risk mitigation. And a culture of innovation encourages risk taking and experimentation through sandboxes. SMEs should stay customer focussed, seek feedback and create new offerings. Roughly right and fast should be the mantra. And financial acumen protects cash flows, and keeps reserves handy.

Once considered a timeless store of value, gold has once again proven its dominance not merely as a hedge against inflation but also as a global signal of shifting trust and changing tides in the world economy. Traditionally, during times of political or economic turbulence, investors would flock to the US Dollar and stateside treasuries for safety. A growing number of emerging market central banks are rewriting that playbook, however; instead of turning to the dollar, they\u2019re increasingly resorting to gold\u2026 by buying and holding it as a secure reserve asset. According to Bloomberg News, the rally in gold reflects deep structural changes in global finance. Silver too has joined the surge and recently reached its highest price (US$ 1.58 a gramme on 22 October) in nearly four decades. But gold\u2019s ascent tells a larger story about confidence, power and the future of global money. Many experts view gold as an indicator of the world\u2019s economic health. Since international divisions are deepening and markets are growing uneasy, gold has once again become the asset of choice. The appeal of gold lies in its simplicity: it is valuable, liquid and universal. Since the turn of the millennium, it has outperformed equities and most other asset classes, and reinforced its reputation as the ultimate hedge against uncertainty. For decades, the dollar was trusted by nations, investors and central banks alike. Yet, recent years have seen that faith waver. The greenback experienced its sharpest six month decline in 50 years while gold recently surged to record highs. And the underlying reason is clear: a loss of global confidence in the American government and its fiscal stability. A major turning point came when the Group of Seven (G7) nations froze the Russian central bank\u2019s assets held in Europe following the invasion of Ukraine. This move sent shockwaves through the international community, and prompted countries such as India and China to rethink their reliance on the dollar. Many central banks began diversifying away from US Dollar holdings to protect themselves from potential future sanctions. Central banks that once sold hundreds of tonnes of gold annually are now buying over 1,000 tonnes annually \u2013 for the third consecutive year. The biggest buyers are China, India and the Czech Republic, with Beijing leading the charge as the world\u2019s largest consumer and producer of gold. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) has been particularly strategic, and reduced its dollar reserves by converting them to gold to strengthen its financial autonomy. This shift underscores the country\u2019s long-term ambition to reshape the world monetary order in its favour. In 2000, the dollar accounted for nearly three-quarters of the world\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. That share continues to fall, eroded by tariffs, inflation and geopolitical sanctions. Meanwhile, gold has become a symbol of resistance and resilience. Some analysts caution that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine or a reversal of US trade tariffs could temper the momentum of gold. But financial institutions such Goldman Sachs predict that the accumulation of gold by central banks will persist and drive further gains in the long run.", "content_hash": "5dbd19dda7f205b56452a2fee3003570", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:07.867882", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:07.867896", "update_count": 0}, "264": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "SRI LANKAN OVERSEAS", "url": "https://lmd.lk/sri-lankan-overseas-dec-2025/", "text": "", "content_hash": "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:11.864161", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:11.864170", "update_count": 0}, "265": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "YOUTH FORUM", "url": "https://lmd.lk/youth-forum-dec-2025/", "text": " Q: What\u2019s the good, the bad and the ugly in Sri Lanka? A: In Sri Lanka, the good still scintillates \u2013 cinnamon scented winds, temples and mosques reaching the same sky, calm oceans, and groups of brown skinned people of diverse races, some simply draped, others richly adorned \u2013 yet, all harmonious in colour and spirit. The bad however, creeps in quietly. Promises sour before they ripen and leaders preach unity while tightening invisible chains. A dream of utopia \u2013 where humanity stands as one family, free of boundaries and divisions \u2013 remains the language of poets and the comfort of fairy tales. And the ugly in Sri Lanka is how such sublime notions of harmony are too often overshadowed by racism and social divides. Q: And what are the challenges facing the country today? A: It is difficult to understand the issued facing the nation without acknowledging the three decades of conflict and manner in which it ended. We may welcome the quiet that followed but silence does not erase the scars; the past sits heavy, seeping into politics and trust. The present situation is a product of this history. In addition, there are new complexities such as the impact of the first global pandemic of the Anthropocene era. And today, the country faces another kind of loss \u2013 not on the battlefield but through departures. As skilled professionals in medicine, IT and business leave, in search of stability and opportunity, offices grow emptier and clinics quieter, devoid of the very lifeblood needed for recovery. Q: What are the challenges facing young people in Sri Lanka today? A: Young people walk a narrow bridge. A mismatch between the school curriculum and current labour market demands, limited access to digital tools and resources, the notable digital divide and the gap in mentoring for 21 st century skills \u2013 including digital literacy and innovation form a maze of obsta\u00adcles confronting youth today. Q: So how can our youth contribute to national progress? A: The youth must immerse themselves in something \u2013 a craft, a skill or a field \u2013 until it becomes a part of who they are. In their hands lies hope: that every effort can churn the slow wheels of a nation and mend its frayed edges. Q: What type of leadership do you think the world needs right now? A: The canvas we live in is in urgent need of leaders who don\u2019t avert their eyes. In the malefic malaise of human conflict, the rubble chants louder than the living. Palestine shows us what happens when leadership becomes an exercise in resolutions and condemnations \u2013 gestures that fade like smoke while children sleep beneath shattered roofs. Venom and vengeance know no bounds. Traditions built and nurtured over centuries have taken on a different form; war cries have replaced the sweet lullabies that once laid the young to sleep. And weapons of modern warfare have taken control of the psyche of those in power. The world needs leaders who are ready to carry the weight of human suffering without turning it into a spectacle \u2013 those who believe true authority lies not in domination but in the fragile, stubborn act of protecting dignity where it\u2019s most denied. Q: How has the advent of AI and technology shaped your view of the future? A: AI is a double edged sword. I see tools that connect us and create opportunities once thought impossible. I also see shadows \u2013 human voices drowned out by algorithms and power concentrated in invisible hands. It leaves me both hopeful and uneasy as though we are building the future faster than we\u2019re learning how to live in it. Q: As a young person, what are your hopes for and concerns about the future? A: I hope for a future where progress doesn\u2019t demean the pulse of life \u2013 where ambition and growth coexist with understanding. Yet, I fear a world where we may be lost in the rat race, allowing joy, friendship and meaning to evaporate like mist in a sunless corridor. Q: If you could launch a project or movement in Sri Lanka, what would it be \u2013 and why? A: If I were to launch a movement, it would be to ensure that every overlooked voice is heard. Only when all are acknowledged can a nation advance with true purpose and the future cannot take shape until every whispered truth finds its place.", "content_hash": "1197588837548a61ac7325fefde369b6", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:14.172789", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:14.172805", "update_count": 0}, "266": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "SRI LANKAN OVERSEAS", "url": "https://lmd.lk/sri-lankan-overseas-nov-2025/", "text": "Your email address will not be published.

The Group\u2019s disciplined execution and focus on financial resilience have resulted in a sustained turnaround from the previous year, strengthening its position as a key enabler of Sri Lanka\u2019s digital economy. In the third quarter of 2025, the Group advanced the strong performance achieving Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs 2.2 billion, compared to Rs 1.1 billion in Q3 2024. Reduced finance costs contributed significantly to the 100.2% surge in profitability. At company level, SLT PLC witnessed similar traction, posting a sharp improvement in PAT of Rs. 1.4 billion, against Rs. 932 million Year-over-Year (YoY), signalling a 53% increase driven by lower interest costs. Mobitel delivered a surge in profits contributing Rs. 639 million, compared to Rs. 17 million in Q3 2024, denoting an exceptional 3,660% improvement.

The Group\u2019s Profit Before Tax surged by 93% compared to Q3 2024, with net profit showcasing similar momentum, increasing by 100% over the same quarter last year. Mobitel\u2019s pre-tax profit alone surged 125% to Rs. 1,039 million. Group revenue for Q3 2025 stood at Rs. 29.5 billion, heralding a 3.3% increase YoY. SLT company-level revenue rose by 1.7%, with key growth drivers being broadband, SME segment, and enterprise revenue services. Mobitel\u2019s performance remained a key driver of growth, with revenue increasing 4% from Rs. 11,651 million to Rs. 12,115 million. These gains indicate the continued strength of Mobitel\u2019s market positioning and service delivery, particularly in data services and network quality.

For Q3 2025, direct costs declined by 3.8% at Group level and by 5.8% at SLT, while Mobitel maintained cost stability with operating costs reducing by 2.5% through efficiency measures. Sales and marketing expenses rose by 14.5% at Group level, driven by SLT\u2019s 27.4% increase during Q3 2025. Mobitel, in contrast, recorded a decrease in marketing expenditure. Administrative expenses increased by 8.2% at Group level, with SLT and Mobitel contributing proportionately to this rise in line with strategic growth initiatives. Finance costs saw a notable reduction in Q3 2025, with Group-level interest expenses down by 24.2% and SLT achieving a 30.1% decline due to reduced borrowings and improved financial management. Mobitel\u2019s finance costs rose slightly, due to increased borrowing directed on investments in network coverage and capacity. These shifts provide the Group\u2019s continued focus on balancing investment with financial prudence, strengthening the position as a resilient and forward-looking leader in Sri Lanka\u2019s telecommunications sector.

The results showcase impressive profitability growth backed by sound core banking operational growth as evidenced by net operating income and pre-tax profit expands by 32.3% and 62.1% to reach LKR 28.4 billion and LKR 11.0 billion, respectively (9M-24: LKR 21.5 billion and LKR 6.8 billion). Fund based income Net interest income improved by 6.4% to LKR 25.9 billion over 2024. This is noteworthy considering the tapering interest rate environment which prevailed during the period under review. Reflecting the Bank\u2019s efforts to diligently maintain its margins, Net Interest Margins broadly stabilized at 4.1% (2024: 4.3%) which, excluding items of a one-off nature, was 4.3% on a like for like basis (2024: 4.5%). At end September 2025, the Bank had close to LKR 46.8 billion in Loans and Deposits under a special arrangement with its customer(s) with a netting-off feature (end 2024: LKR 19.6 billion). Non-fund based income Net fee and commission income grew by 13.8% to reach LKR 5.8 billion YoY, whilst for the third quarter alone it reported an impressive 24.2% over the third quarter of 2024. This evidenced targeted efforts made to strengthen non-fund sources of income, thereby enhancing the resilience of the Bank\u2019s overall income composition. This growth was enabled by improved performance across almost all aspects of the Bank\u2019s core business operations. Credit and operating costs Impairment charges continued to decline, driven by concerted efforts to enhance the quality of the loan book, resulting in a charge of LKR 5.9 billion for the period under review, representing a 46.7% reduction YoY. The resultant total impairment coverage ratio, excluding such one-off items of a special nature stood at 8.8% (end 2024:10.1%); which compared well with industry averages at the said period end. Operating expenses netted LKR 13.9 billion, marking a 14.8% YoY increase \u2013 predominantly driven by staff related routine increments and realignments to the industry, and higher investments in IT infrastructure and those of a direct business development nature. Investor key performance indicators Return on average equity was 12.4% during the nine months period whilst for the third quarter alone it was 16.0%. Annualized Earnings per share was LKR 23.41 for the said period which was LKR 21.25 for 2024. Respective ratios at a Group level were 12.6% (2024: 12.5%) and LKR 25.28 (2024: LKR 23.05), respectively. The Bank\u2019s pre-tax return on average assets was 2.3% whilst, for the third quarter alone, it was 2.6% (2024: 3.1%, 1.5%, respectively). Net asset value per share was LKR 194.01 (2024: LKR 186.91) and compared with a closing share price of LKR 142.00, which posted a 25.4% appreciation since end 2024. Group Net asset value per share was LKR 207.34 (2024: LKR 199.13).

Excluding transactions of a one off and special nature, this represented a normalized absolute net growth of 7.2% and 22.1% over end 2024, respectively. The Bank\u2019s CASA ratio on a normalized basis was 23.8% having improved from 22.5% at end 2024. This continued to reflect the Bank\u2019s efforts to consistently improve its low cost funding from current levels. The Bank\u2019s Impaired loans (Stage 3) to total loans ratio was 4.5% (end 2024: 5.2%) which compared well with the industry average. Its Stage 3 provision coverage was 55.6% (end 2024: 54.5%) which also was close to the industry norm. LIQUIDITY AND SOLVENCY Liquidity levels also remained strong with the Bank\u2019s Liquidity coverage ratios, across both Rupee and All currency, being 343.3% and 226.6%, respectively at September 30, 2025 (end 2024: 358.1% and 308.3%) and its Net stable funding ratio was 136.1% (end 2024: 152.4%) \u2013 all of which were well above the minimum regulatory requirements of 100.0%. The Bank\u2019s solvency levels as measured by CET1/ Tier I and Total CAR were 11.5% and 15.4%, respectively representing adequate buffers over its regulatory minimums (end 2024: 13.7% and 19.1%). Commenting on the financial results for the nine months\u2019 period under review , the Bank\u2019s Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kelum Edirisinghe, stated: \u201cOur performance over the nine months\u2019 period ended provides ample testimony to the consistent positive progress made across almost all aspects of our business operations. It reflects the strategic clarity, agility, and commitment of our staff at all levels in navigating this fast-paced market landscape whilst creating excellence in every aspect of our operations. These results also speak for our internal resilience and operational excellence, and also to the encouraging progress of the Sri Lankan economy, which we are proud to be a part of. Amongst others, one of our key performance highlights is growth of Small and Medium Scale Enterprise (SME) loan book which expanded by over 24.0% on a year-to-date basis underscoring the Bank\u2019s commitment to support the sector. Looking ahead, we remain focused on further sharpening our strategic focus with significant groundwork underway.

While the budget did not introduce any major reforms, the president assured that Sri Lanka is on track to regain the economic output lost during the 2022 crisis. According to him, macroeconomic stability has been restored and investor confidence regained. Meanwhile, the World Bank forecasts economic growth of 4.6 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent next year, reflecting a moderate but sustained recovery. And in its latest Sri Lanka development update titled Better Spending for All, the World Bank notes that while the economy has shown solid signs of recovery, the rebound remains incomplete with output still below pre-crisis levels and poverty rates persistently high. THE INDEX The LMD-PEPPERCUBE Business Confidence Index (BCI) tumbled by 23 basis points from its record high of 212 in October, falling to 189 in November. As for key benchmarks, the index now stands 64 points above its historic median of 125 and 17 notches higher than the gauge\u2019s lowest point in the last 12 months (172) \u2013 and it is five points shy of the 12 month average of 194. For context, the BCI registered a modest 154 in November last year. According to PepperCube Consultants, the BCI\u2019s downgrade reflects a wave of uncertainty and apprehension within the business community in the lead up to the budget. It notes that while overall optimism remains intact, sentiment has shifted towards greater caution \u2013 particularly regarding long-term economic and sales prospects. And it cautions that sustaining confidence will depend on the implementation of targeted policies focussed on human capital development, operational efficiency and a clear plan to address broader socioeconomic challenges. PROJECTIONS The erosion of confidence following yet another short-lived record high raises questions about the depth of the resurgence in sentiment in the last 12 months. The recent surge in biz confidence appears unsustainable with the barometer expected to fluctuate like a seesaw in the months ahead. In fact, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s World Economic Outlook (WEO) survey released in October echoes this uncertainty, noting that while the short-term growth momentum persists, the global environment remains volatile. What\u2019s more, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has cautioned that the international order should brace itself for three possible financial bubbles \u2013 viz. crypto, AI and debt markets \u2013 even as global hostilities appear to have eased for the time being. Here at home, budget related anxiety and the recent spate of gang related violence, sensationally labelled with flashy names, have turned attention away from where the economy is heading. Against this backdrop, as predicted in this column in recent months, November\u2019s decline in confidence is likely to set the tone for the next six to 12 months. That said, it may well be that the budget verdict rings a positive tone next month, so we could see more volatility in the BCI in the near term.", "content_hash": "58ae876033da9492fbd28e72d17b8222", "scraped_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:46.502620", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T21:53:46.502630", "update_count": 0}, "280": {"source": "LMD", "section": "home", "title": "BURNING ISSUES", "url": "https://lmd.lk/burning-issues-dec-2025/", "text": "High taxes continue to dominate the narrative in business circles, emerging yet again as the chief concern for the 10 th straight month.
